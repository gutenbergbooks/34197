<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In these days when books on every conceivable
subject are written in their thousands annually;
when monthly journals are produced by scores,
and daily newspapers in hundreds, to supply the
public with a record of the world's doings; and
when readers are found for them all, it may not
be thought unfitting that each large mail centre
in the United Kingdom which contributes by its
postal and telegraph organisation to the dissemination
of much of this literature, should in its turn
have some record of its own doings. This present
compilation has, therefore, been undertaken with that
object in view, as regards the Bristol Post Office,
and in the hope that the facts, figures, and incidents
contained in it relating to past doings and present
days and present ways may prove of interest to the
inhabitants of the County and City, and its surrounding
districts, and in an unpretentious way<!--[12.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
commence, or add to, local Post Office history, and
demonstrate that though Bristol is not, unfortunately,
the leading provincial seaport, as of yore, she has
not lagged one step behind her competitors in
respect of postal progress.</p>

<p>The profit which may accrue from the publication
of <i>The Bristol Royal Mail</i> will be devoted exclusively
to the Rowland Hill Memorial and Benevolent Fund,
the chief patron of which is Her Most Gracious
Majesty the Queen-Empress, who is about to show
her great interest in works of the kind by visiting
our ancient city to open the new Convalescent Home.
The object of the fund is the relief of all Post Office
servants throughout the United Kingdom, who,
through no fault of their own, have fallen into
necessitous circumstances. It also affords assistance
to their widows and orphans, for whom no provision
is made under the Superannuation Acts. The fund
is managed by a body of trustees, who are assisted
by a committee of recommendation composed of
officers of the Post Office. The trustees are well-known
gentlemen of high standing and repute in
the city of London, to whose benevolent efforts on
behalf of the department the fund owes its origin.<!--[13.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
The Superannuation Acts afford pensions to those
who have been in the Post Office not less than ten
years. Sometimes a deserving and distressed Post
Office servant has not served long enough to qualify
for a pension, and sometimes help is needed by
persons whose time has been partly spent in the
postal service, but who, because they have been
permitted to carry on some other occupation, are not
entitled by law to any pension at all. A pension,
even if it should prove to be sufficient for the pensioner's
own support, ceases at death, and the widow
and orphans are often left destitute. There are
more than eighty-one thousand, and, counting those
employed only a portion of their time, nearly one
hundred and fifty thousand servants in the Post
Office; and in comparison with the number of
persons amongst whom cases needing relief may
arise, the assured income at the disposal of the
trustees of the fund is still inadequate. In the
period since 1893 the trustees have granted to
necessitous cases in the Bristol district &pound;120, so
that any proceeds from the sale of this book will
be bestowed where such bestowal is certainly due.</p>

<p>It is right to state that some of the information<!--[14.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
in these pages has been derived from <i>The
History of the Post Office</i>, by the late Mr. Herbert
Joyce, C.B.; <i>Forty Years at the Post Office</i>, by Mr. F.
E. Baines, C.B.; <i>The Royal Mail</i>, by Mr. J. Wilson
Hyde; and from <i>St. Martin's-le-Grand Magazine</i>,
also Latimer's <i>Annals of Bristol</i>. Thanks are due
also to Mr. Norris Mathews, the Bristol City
Librarian, for his courtesy in permitting and facilitating
access to old records in the Public Library;
to Mr. H. J. Spear, Secretary to the Chamber of
Commerce; to the proprietors of the <i>Times and

DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAIL SERVICES.<br />
RALPH ALLEN.</h5>


<p>It appears that before Post Offices were established
special messengers were employed to carry
letters. It is recorded that such a special messenger
was paid the sum of one penny for carrying a letter
from Bristol to London in the year 1532, but the
record affords no further particulars as to the service,
and the assumption is that the special messenger
was, in his own person, a rough-and-ready "post."
Later on, a post would be suddenly established for
a particular purpose, and as soon abandoned when
no longer specially required. Thus in the year 1621
a post to Ireland&mdash;Irish firms being then considered<!--[16.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to require "oftener despatches and more expedition"&mdash;was
set up by way of Bristol, only to be
discontinued in a few years.</p>

<p>There was in 1660 a direct but irregular post
between London and some of the larger provincial
towns, but there were no cross posts between two
towns not being on the same post road. Letters
could only circulate from one post road to another
through London, and such circulation through
London involved additional rates of postage. Bristol
and Exeter are less than eighty miles apart, but,
not being on the same post road, letters from one
place to the other passed through London, and
were charged, if single, 6d., thus:&mdash;one rate of 3d.
from Exeter to London, and another rate of 3d.
from London to Bristol. This was in conformity
with a system established in the reign of Charles II.
That system went on until 1696 when a post was
established between Bristol and Exeter, that being
the first cross post in the kingdom authorised by
the Monarch's own personal assent. From Bristol
the posts went on Mondays and Fridays, starting
at 10.0 in the morning. The posts left Exeter on
Wednesdays and Saturdays at 4.0 in the afternoon,<!--[17.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and arrived at Bristol at the same hour on the
following days. Under this cross post plan, the
two towns being less than eighty miles apart, the
charge was reduced to 2d. for a single letter. In
three or four years the new post produced a profit
of &pound;250 a year. In 1678 Provost Campbell established
a coach to run from Glasgow to Edinburgh,
"drawn by sax able horses, to leave Edinboro' ilk
Monday morning, and return again (God willing)
ilk Saturday night." In 1700 the service between
Bristol and London became fixed, and on alternate
days at irregular hours, depending upon the state
of the weather and the roads, the extent of the
journey and the caprices of the postboys and the
sorry nags that carried them, the mail arrived in
Bristol. There were, however, only a mere handful
of letters and newspapers. At the end of the same
year, the Post Office authorities in London, after
being earnestly petitioned by local merchants,
counselled the Government to establish a "cross
post" from this city to Chester. Up to that time
the Bristol letters to Chester, Shrewsbury, Worcester,
and Gloucester had been carried round
by London under the system already described,<!--[18.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
involving double postage and great delay. The
effect of this system, as on the Bristol and Exeter
road, had been to throw nearly all the letters into
the hands of public carriers, by whose wagons they
were conveyed more quickly than by the postboys
through London, and at a cheaper rate. Moved
by the success of the new cross posts from Bristol
to Exeter, the Treasury consented to the starting
of the Chester service. The Post Office reported
to the Treasury in March, 1702, that the profit for
the first eighteen months of the Chester service
had been about &pound;156. The accounts of Henry Pyne,
the Bristol postmaster, appended to the report in
the State papers, show that so far as this part of
the service was concerned, he had received &pound;168 for
letters by this post, whilst his expenses had been
&pound;60.</p>

<p>The people of Cirencester and Exeter, hearing
of the Chester concession, hastened to complain
of shortcomings affecting themselves. The Devon
clothiers had a considerable trade with the wool
dealers of the district of Cirencester, which town
was served by the postboys riding between Gloucester
and London, with a branch postboy mail to<!--[21.png]-->

Wotton-under-Edge. By there being no direct postal
service of any kind between Bristol and Wotton-under-Edge,
correspondence between Exeter and
Cirencester had to be sent <i>vi&acirc;</i> London, and a fortnight
elapsed between the despatch of a letter and
the receipt of an answer, the result being that not
one letter in twenty was sent through the post. All
that was needed to shorten the transit from fourteen
days to four was to put Bristol in direct communication
with Wotton, the expense being estimated at
only &pound;30 a year. The Government declined to
comply with this reasonable request, and nothing
was done!</p>

<p>Soon after this time a Post Office reformer arose in
our immediate district in the person of Ralph Allen.
He, unlike later reformers, passed all his working
days in the Post Office service. Born at the "Duke
William Inn," at St. Blazey Highway, in Cornwall
in about 1693, he went as a boy to help his grandmother,
who was postmistress at St. Columb. In
1710 he was transferred as a clerk to Bath, and on
the 26th March, 1712, he became postmaster of that
city, in succession to one Mary Collins, and in that
year appears to have taken over the management of<!--[22.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the Bristol and Exeter Cross Road Post, previously
farmed by Joseph Quash, postmaster of Exeter. In
1720 Ralph Allen contracted to farm the cross-country
posts throughout the country generally, and
to carry the mails by what were subsequently known
as "Allen's Postboys," who were supposed to travel
on horseback at a pace averaging five miles an hour.
A robbery from these postboys carrying the mails
between London and Bristol was a common occurrence.
Two men were executed in April, 1720, for
having twice committed that crime, yet the letter bags
were again stolen seven times during the following
twelve months. The <i>London Journal</i> of August 27th
remarked: "It is computed that the traders of
Bristol have received &pound;60,000 damages by the late
robberies of the mail." In 1722 the postboys were
robbed twice in a single week, and for the crimes
three men were executed in London. Another
incident of the kind worthy of mentioning occurred
in September, 1738. The bag then carried off by
three highwaymen contained a reprieve for a man
lying under sentence of death in Newgate, and a
second reprieve despatched after the robbery became
known would have arrived too late to save the man's<!--[25.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<!--[24.png]-->
<!--[23.png]-->
life, had not the magistrates postponed the execution
for a day or two in order that it might not clash with
the festivities of a new Mayor's inauguration.</p>

<p>About 1732 the Bristol riding boys were deprived
of their perquisite of 1d. a letter for "dropping of
letters" at the towns and villages through which
they passed. This was done because the postboys
not only carried letters which they picked up on
the road and did not account for at the next post
office of call, but even went to the length of taking
out letters from the mail bags when those bags
were, as was the case sometimes, not properly
chained and sealed. In connection with Ralph
Allen's "By-Posts," in the year 1735 arrangements
were made so that the mails sent from Manchester,
Liverpool, or any other place in Lancashire, to
Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Devon,
etc., might be answered four days sooner than
they could possibly have been answered before.
In 1740 a new branch by-post was established from
Bristol and Bath to Salisbury, through Bradford,
Trowbridge, Devizes, Lavington, Tinhead, Westbury,
Warminster, Heytesbury, and Wilton. In 1741
the growth of trade and population encouraged the<!--[26.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Bristol citizens to appeal to the Ministry for an
improvement in the postal communication with
London, which was still limited to three days per
week. Yielding to this pressure, Allen converted
the tri-weekly posts into six-day posts in June,
1741. The post began to run every day of the
week, except Sunday, between London and Bristol,
and all intervening towns participated in the benefit.
In 1746 a further extension took place, whereby
letters were conveyed six days in every week,
instead of three days, at Mr. Allen's expense,
between London and Wells, Bridgwater, Taunton,
Wellington, Tiverton, and Exeter, through Bristol.
The mail service is not in further evidence in local
history until 1753, when the Bristol merchants again
showed themselves tenacious of their rights, and
waged a bitter war against the Postmasters-General
in respect of the imposition of a double rate of
postage on letters which, although under an ounce
in weight, contained patterns of silk or cotton or
samples of grain. There was a lawsuit, and the
Bristol merchants won it.</p>

<p>A Government notification in the local newspapers
of the 4th September, 1752, announced an acceleration<!--[29.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<!--[28.png]-->
of the mails between the Southern Counties and
Bristol. In future a postboy was to leave Salisbury
on Mondays at six o'clock in the morning, to arrive
at Bath (a distance of about thirty-nine miles) at
eight or nine at night, and to leave Bath for Bristol
at six next morning. On Wednesdays and Fridays
the departure from Salisbury was in the evening,
the journey occupying about nineteen hours. By
this arrangement letters from Portsmouth were
received in this city two days earlier than before.</p>

<p>Ralph Allen's improvements had great influence
in the Post Office services in this western city. The
profits on the contracts enabled Allen to take up
his residence at Prior Park, Bath, one of the finest
Italian houses in England, in addition to having a
grand house in the City. It is said that the
profits which accrued to him from his long contracts
amounted to about half a million of money.</p>

<p>Mansions so lordly are not for the hardest and
best workers in the Post Office field of present
times, for the nation does not reward its great
men so liberally as then. Nowadays an introducer

and leader in bringing about vastly accelerated
mail services throughout the country,&mdash;works of
great moment, even if not comparable with Ralph
Allen, John Palmer, or Rowland Hill's great
achievements,&mdash;has, after forty years at the Post
Office, to be contented on retirement with no more
than the modest pension due to him, which will
not even be continued to his nearest and dearest
relative.</p>

<p>Allen benefited the Bristol postal district in
another way than by his improved Post Office
services when he built the bridge over the Avon
at Newton-St.-Loe at a cost of &pound;4,000. He was
buried in Claverton Churchyard, near Bath. The
inscription on his tomb runs thus:&mdash;"Beneath this
Monument lieth entombed the Body of Ralph
Allen, Esqr., of Prior Park, who departed this
life y<sup>e</sup> 29th day of June, 1764, in the 71st year
of his Age. In full hope of everlasting happiness
in another state thro' the infinite merit and mediation
of our blessed Redeemer, Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>Ralph Allen did not hoard up his money or
spend it on riotous living, but bestowed a considerable
portion of his income in works of charity,<!--[31.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
especially in supporting needy men of letters. He
was a great friend and benefactor of Fielding, and
in <i>Tom Jones</i> the novelist has gratefully drawn Mr.
Allen's character in the person of Squire Alworthy.
He enjoyed the friendship of Chatham and Pitt;
and Pope, Warburton, and other men of literary
distinction were his familiar companions. Pope has
celebrated one of his principal virtues&mdash;unassuming
benevolence&mdash;in the well-known lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let humble Allen, with an awkward shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Derrick has thus described Allen's personal
appearance shortly before his death: "He is a
very grave, well-looking man, plain in his dress,
resembling that of a Quaker, and courteous in his
behaviour. I suppose he cannot be much under
seventy. His wife is low, with grey hair, and of
a very pleasing address." Kilvert says that he was
rather above the middle size and stoutly built, and
that he was not altogether averse to a little state,
as he often used to drive into Bath in a coach
and four. His handwriting was very curious; he
evidently wrote quickly and fluently, but it was so<!--[32.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
overloaded with curls and flourishes as to be sometimes
scarcely legible.</p>

<p>The lack of all show about his garb seems to
have somewhat annoyed Philip Thicknesse, the
well-known author of one of the Bath Guides, for
he speaks of Allen's "plain linen shirt-sleeves, with
only a chitterling up the slit."</p>

<p>Allen's son Philip became Comptroller of the
"By-Letter" Department in the London Post
Office.<!--[33.png]--></p>

MAIL COACH ERA.&mdash;JOHN PALMER.</h5>


<p>Notwithstanding Ralph Allen's innovations,
the conveyance of letters between the
principal towns was carried on in a more or less
desultory fashion. Speaking of the want of improvement
in 1770, and the haphazard system under
which Post Office business was conducted, a local
newspaper gave this instance of unpunctuality: "The
London Mail did not arrive so soon by several hours
as usual on Monday, owing to the mailman getting
a little intoxicated on his way between Newbury
and Marlborough, and falling from his horse into a
hedge, where he was found asleep, by means of his
dog." Mr. Weeks, who entered upon "The Bush,"
Bristol, in 1772, after ineffectually urging the proprietors
to quicken their speed, started a one day
coach to Birmingham himself, and carried it on
against a bitter opposition, charging the passengers<!--[36.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
only 10s. 6d. and 8s. 6d. for inside and outside seats
respectively, and giving each one of them a dinner
and a pint of wine at Gloucester into the bargain.
After two years' struggle his opponents gave in,
and one day journeys to Birmingham became the
established rule.</p>

<p>The mail service was carried on chiefly by means
of postboys (generally wizened old men), who
continued to travel on worn-out horses not able
to get along at a speed of more than four miles an
hour on the bad roads. On the London and Bristol
route, indeed, it had been found necessary to provide
the postboys with light carts, but that method of
conveyance of the mail bags brought about no
acceleration in time of transit,&mdash;from thirty to forty
hours, according to the state of the roads. A letter
despatched from Bristol or Bath on Monday was not
delivered in London until Wednesday morning. On
the other hand a letter confided to the stage coach of
Monday reached its destination on Tuesday morning,
and the consequence was that Bristol traders and
others sent letters of value or urgency by the stage
coach, although the proprietors charged 2s. for each
missive.<!--[37.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>At this period John Palmer, of Bath, came on
the scene. He had learnt from the merchants
of Bristol what a boon it would be if they could
get their letters conveyed to London in fourteen
or fifteen hours, instead of three days. It is
said, however, that it was the sight of Ralph
Allen's grand place at Prior Park, and the knowledge
of how Allen's money had been made, which
first suggested to Palmer the attempt to bring a
scheme for a mail coach system to the notice of
the postal authorities. John Palmer was lessee and
manager of the Bath and Bristol theatres, and went
about beating up actors, actresses and companies in
postchaises, and he thought letters should be carried
at the same pace at which it was possible to travel
in a chaise. He devised a scheme, and Pitt, the
Prime Minister of the day, who warmly approved
the idea, decided that the plan should have a trial
and that the first mail coach should run between
London and Bristol. On Saturday, the 31st July,
1784, an agreement was signed in connection with
Palmer's scheme under which, in consideration
of payment of 3d. a mile, five inn-holders&mdash;one
belonging to London, one to Thatcham, one to<!--[38.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Marlborough, and two to Bath&mdash;undertook to provide
the horses, and on Monday, the 2nd August, 1784,
the first "mail coach" started. On its first journey
it ran from Bristol,&mdash;not from London as generally
supposed,&mdash;and Palmer was present to see it off. A
well-armed mail guard in uniform was in charge of
the vehicle, which was timed to perform the journey
from Bristol to London in sixteen hours. Only four
passengers were at first carried by each "machine,"
and the fare was &pound;1 8s. The immediate effect was
to accelerate the delivery of letters by a day. The
coaches were small, light vehicles, drawn by a pair of
horses only, but leaders were subsequently added, and
four-horse coaches soon became the order of the day,
and more passengers were carried. An old painting
represents the Bath and Bristol mail trotting along
close to a wall, the guard receiving one bag and
handing another to the postmaster without the
coachman pulling up. One coach left Bristol at 4.0
in the afternoon, reached Bath a couple of hours
later, and arrived at the General Post Office, London,
before 8.0 the next morning. The down coach
started from London at 8.0 in the evening, was at
the "Three Tuns," Bath, at a few minutes before<!--[41.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<!--[40.png]-->
10.0 the next morning, and pulled up at the
"Rummer Tavern," Bristol, at noon. Palmer gave
up his theatrical enterprises and entered the service
of the Post Office as Comptroller at a salary of
&pound;1,500 a year, and certain emoluments, which,
after a year or two, brought him in an annual sum
of more than &pound;3,000. Before Palmer's mail coaches
were at work the post left London at all hours of
the night, but it was part of his scheme that the
mails should all leave at the same time, 8.0; and as
the number of mails increased so there was more
and more bustle in the vicinity of the General Post
Office at that hour. In London the arrival of all
the mails was awaited before any one of them was
delivered; and this led to the delivery sometimes not
taking place until 3.0 or 4.0 in the afternoon, or
even later. Palmer, with his regard for the Bristol
coach, occasionally had the Bristol mails distributed
immediately on reaching St. Martin's-le-Grand, but
all other mails if behind were kept waiting as
before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Old English &quot;Flying&quot; Mail Coach.</span>
</div>

<p>Upon the beginning of Palmer's system on the
Bristol road a marvellous superstructure was raised.
Coaches were at once applied for by the municipalities<!--[42.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of the largest towns, Liverpool being the first to aim
at equality with Bristol, and York claiming what
was due to the great highway to the North.
Palmer's plan made rapid progress and was attended
with complete success. A splendid mail service was
eventually set up all over the country. One result
was that the "expresses" to Bristol, which before
had been as many as two hundred in the year,
ceased altogether. In July, 1787, the mails from
Bristol to Birmingham and the North, previously
three per week, were ordered to be run daily. The
London to Bristol coach was stopped by other means
than those employed by highwaymen, the service
having at one time in 1790 been suspended
for several days by Palmer, in defiance of the
Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>In Bonner and Middleton's (weekly) <i>Journal</i> for
the 11th February, 1792, is an announcement to the
effect that the Irish mails arrived in Bristol on the
6th instant instead of on the first of the month. The
bare fact was stated, and the assumption is, therefore,
that it was not an unusual circumstance. Five days'
delay would be thought intolerable now, as, indeed,
is the present length of time occupied by the Irish<!--[45.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
<!--[44.png]-->
night mails on their journey to Bristol. After being
conveyed by fast boat to Holyhead and express train
to Birmingham, they come on from that city by a
"crawler" and do not reach Bristol until nearly the
mid-day hour.</p>

<p>In the same year (1792) sixteen mail coaches
worked in and out of London every day. There
were fifteen cross-country mail coaches, as, for
instance, the coach between Bristol and Oxford, or,
as it was commonly called, Mr. Pickwick's coach.
During winter, in frosty weather, at this period,
some of the mail coaches did not run at all, but
were laid up for the season, like ships during
Arctic frosts.</p>

<p>There is a model of an old mail coach at the
General Post Office, St. Martin's-le-Grand, London,
popularly supposed to be the model of the first mail
coach which was built, but such is not the case, for,
as already stated, the first mail coach ran between
Bristol and London, and the model has upon it
the inscription "Royal Mail from London to
Liverpool."</p>

<p>The expense of horsing a four-horsed coach
running at the speed of from nine to ten miles an<!--[46.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
hour was reckoned at &pound;3 a double mile. Mails
were exempt from turnpike tolls.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the mail coaches with
well-armed, resolute guards, there was a cessation of
mail robberies on the main roads. Pilfering, however,
was occasionally carried on; for instance, in the
early winter of 1794 one Thomas Thomas travelled
day after day up and down on the London and
Bristol coach. At last his opportunity came when
the guard temporarily left his coach with the mailbox
unlocked, and then Thomas Thomas looted the
mails. On the cross roads the saddle horse and cart
posts were frequently stopped and robbed (1796).
One of the worst roads in this respect was that
between Bristol and Portsmouth. Proposals for
the postboys to be furnished with pistols, cutlasses,
and caps lined with metal, like hunting caps,
for the defence of the head, fell through on account
of the expense which their supply would have
entailed.</p>

<p>There exists a popular belief that the mail
coaches were driven up and down the steep Queen
Street in Bristol now known as Christmas Steps.
The belief is erroneous, for an inscription over<!--[47.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>

<p>Probably, however, the postboys who carried the
mails in earlier days rode up the steep incline.</p>

<p>A gentleman now writing in the <i>Bristol Times and
Mirror</i> under the <i>nom-de-plume</i> of "Old File," delving
in the historical garden of <i>Felix Farley's Journal</i>,
has unearthed the following very interesting announcements
and advertisements, which throw light
on the mail services of the time:&mdash;</p>

Street, Bristol, over the Old Passage (Aust), every
Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday, at noon, and joins
the above coach at Ragland the same day; and a

days." The chief point in the advertisement was
in the paragraph: "N.B.&mdash;This road is nineteen<!--[48.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
miles nearer to Carmarthen and Milford than the

<p>This was replied to by another advertisement, as
follows:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A Caution.</span>&mdash;The public will please to observe
that no other mail coach whatever does now, or ever

<p>As the Bristol mail coach was going through
Reading on the night of Thursday, the 18th
January, 1799, the coachman was shook off the
box, and, through his hands having been so benumbed
by the cold, was unable to save himself.
The guard jumped down and endeavoured to stop
the horses, but without effect. They ran as far
as Hare Hatch (four miles), where the coach changed
horses, and then stopped, having met with no
accident whatever, though they passed two wagons.
The passengers in the coach did not know anything
of it at the time.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Bristol Directory</i> for 1811, the
"Bush Tavern" office in Corn Street, conducted by
John Townsend, played an important part in the
mail coach system of the country. Its announcement
ran thus: "Royal mail coach to London at
4.0 every afternoon; comes in at half-past 11
every morning. 'Loyal Volunteer' to London at
12.0 every day. Royal mail coach to Newport,
Cardiff, Cowbridge, Neath, Swansea, and Carmarthen
every day on the arrival of the London mail. Royal
mail coach through Newport, Cardiff, Cowbridge,
Swansea, Carmarthen, to Haverfordwest and Milford<!--[54.png]-->

the mail, to Swansea every Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday morning at 6 o'clock; returns every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings.</p>

<p>"Royal mail coach to Birmingham through Gloster,
Tewkesbury, Worcester and Bromsgrove every evening

coach to Birmingham every day. Royal mail coach
through Bath to Tetbury, Cirencester, and Oxford,
every morning at quarter-past 7, comes in at 6.0
every evening. Royal mail coach through Bath,
Warminster, and Salisbury to Southampton and
Portsmouth at 3.0 every day; comes in at 10.0 in

and Gosport every day at 5.0 (Saturdays
excepted), comes in at half-past 10.0 at night.

Bridgwater, Taunton, Wellington, and Cullompton
every Tuesday, Thursday."</p>

<p>In 1813 the London to Bristol mail coach was
robbed of the Bankers' parcel, value &pound;2,000 or
upwards. This was made known in the form of a<!--[55.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
warning to the mail guards who travelled in charge
of the Post Office bags. When in 1813-14 the
great frost occurred, the Bristol mail coaches were
obstructed by the heavy snowdrifts on the roads, and
they came in day after day drawn by six horses
each when they could struggle into the City.</p>

<p>The literature of the period yields nothing of
interest again for some time.</p>

<p>The "Bristol Guide" in 1815 stated that&mdash;"Bristow
is the richest city of almost all the cities
of this country, receiving merchandize from neighbouring
and foreign places with the ships under
sail." And again, "Bristow is full of ships from
Ireland, Norway and every part of Europe, which
brought hither great commerce and large foreign
wealth." There was no mention of their carrying
mails.</p>

<p>The year 1818 is memorable in postal annals as
that in which John Palmer died. His decease took
place at Brighton, but not before he had lived long
enough to see mail coaches splendidly turned out.
Palmer, on the conclusion of his connection with
the Post Office, was awarded a pension of &pound;3,000
a year, equal to his full salary, which sum he<!--[56.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
declared did not represent the amount of his salary
and emoluments. Further difficulties ensued, and
his son, Colonel Palmer, fought his father's battles
right manfully in the House, and eventually, in
1813, the Government gave John Palmer a sum
of &pound;50,000.</p>

<p>In recognition of Palmer's great invention, the
Chamber of Commerce of Glasgow not only made
him an honorary member, but voted him fifty
guineas for a piece of plate. The fifty guineas was
spent on a silver cup, which bore the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>A new coach, from "The Bush Hotel" to
Exeter, was put on the road on the 6th of
April, 1819, the time allowed for the journey&mdash;74¾
miles&mdash;being fourteen hours&mdash;less than 5½ miles an
hour. In June, 1820 a new coach started for Manchester,
performing the journey in two days, the intervening
night being spent at Birmingham. To
accomplish the first half of the task, the vehicle left
Bristol at half-past 8 in the morning and reached
Birmingham&mdash;85½ miles&mdash;in thirteen hours. An
advertisement, published in December, 1821,
headed "Speed Increased," informed the public
that the "Regulator" coach left London daily at
5 a.m. and arrived at the "White Hart," Bristol,
at five minutes before 9 at night, the speed being
barely seven miles an hour.<!--[60.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>


<p>No fewer than twenty-two coaches were by this
time utilised daily between this city and London.
The start of the West Country mail coaches from
Piccadilly at this period was an interesting sight.
The continued wretched condition of the highways
was not conducive to quick travelling; but
in about 1825 matters were improved in that
respect in our district by Mr. John Loudon
MacAdam, who studied and practised road-making.
Mr. MacAdam was general surveyor of Bristol turnpike
roads, and although he found the trustees'
funds only one remove from bankruptcy and their
roads almost impassable, he succeeded so well that
the finances flourished, and his highways became an
object lesson to the world. Mr. Latimer, the Bristol
historian, mentions that although MacAdam was
shabbily treated by members of the old unreformed
Corporation, and had many opponents, Bristol
deserves the credit of being the first to appreciate
the value of his labours, which were recognised
later by a Parliamentary grant. He left Bristol
for London, and died in 1836; but his son became
surveyor of the Bristol roads, and continued to hold
the appointment till his death in 1857.<!--[61.png]--></p>

<p>The <i>Gentlemen's Magazine</i>, November, 1827, announced:
"A Steam Coach Company are now
making arrangements for stopping places on the
line of road, between London, Bath and Bristol,
which will occur every six or seven miles, where
fresh fuel and water are to be supplied. There are
fifteen coaches built." The Turnpike Trustees, who
imposed extraordinary tolls on steam carriages,
frustrated this scheme; but the threatened competition
stirred up the coach proprietors, who increased
the speed of their vehicles from the jog-trot
of six or seven miles an hour, although not to such
an extent as desired by the Bristol Chamber of
Commerce, which in this year made a suggestion to
the Post Office for bringing the London mail to the
city in twelve hours. The Postmaster-General was
also memorialised to accelerate the arrival of the
West mail, so as to effect its delivery before the
departure of the London mail,&mdash;a convenience of no
little moment to the West India trade of the port,
since it was thought that it would save one day in
the conduct of business with the metropolis. At a
general meeting in January, 1828, it was announced
that the president had a conference on the subject<!--[64.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with the leading officer of the Post Office Department,
with the result that the latter proposed
alterations which were carried out, and were held
to be proofs of the Postmaster-General's disposition
to consult the accommodation of the Bristol public.
The former proposal was not adopted at the time,
for at the Accession of his late Majesty King
William IV. (1830) the London mail coach took
13 hours 37 minutes on its journey <i>vi&acirc;</i> Reading.
It departed at 8 p.m., reached Bath 8.11 a.m., and
arrived in Bristol at 9.37 a.m., leaving again at
5.50 p.m. for the G.P.O. The Bristol and Brighton
coach (138 miles) was bound to a speed of 10.4
miles per hour.</p>

<p>In January, 1830, there were further Post Office
matters on the agenda of the Chamber of Commerce,
for it was resolved&mdash;"That this meeting recommends
to the Board the instituting an enquiry into
the exact distance between the Post Office of London
and Bristol, with a view to ascertain whether the
rate of postage at present demanded is correct."
The enquiry was prosecuted with vigour, for at
the January annual meeting in the following year
reference was made to the Turnpike Commissioners<!--[65.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
for the several districts on the line of road between
London and Bristol having supplied a statement of
the precise extent of ground over which the mail
coach travelled, comprised in their respective trusts.
In several instances measurements were expressly
made. In the result it appeared that the route
exceeded in distance 120 miles, and the Post Office
Department was therefore entitled legally to obtain
the rate of 10d. per letter as the amount fixed by the
provisions of the Act of Parliament. It was thought
by taking the route from Chippenham through
Marshfield instead of Bath the distance would be
considerably shorter, and consequently bring about
a reduced rate of postage. It was reported in the
next year (January, 1832) that the requisition for
changing the route had been pursued, and the
president held a conference with Sir F. Freeling
on the subject; but though every due consideration
was promised, the alteration had not yet been
acceded to. There was the significant addition that
the application would nevertheless be renewed. A
new royal mail direct from Bristol to Liverpool was
established in 1831, leaving the "White Lion,"
Broad Street, Bristol, at 5.0 p.m., reaching Liverpool<!--[66.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
at twenty minutes past 12 a.m. The new service
was notified to Mr. Samuel Harford, the President
of the Commerce Chamber, by Sir Francis Freeling,
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class='right'>
"G.P.O., <i>27th August, 1831</i>.<br />

that His Grace the Postmaster General (Duke of
Richmond) has consented to try the experiment

myself that it may commence about the middle
of next month.</p>

<p>

<br /></p>


<p>In the next year the Chamber learnt with satisfaction
that the direct Liverpool mail through<!--[67.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Chepstow, Monmouth, Hereford, Shrewsbury and
Chester, which was started as an experiment, had
been continued, to the decided advantage of the
public, particularly to all connected with the line of
country through which it passed. As compared with
the former route, the saving of time was equal to
one day; the rate of postage was likewise reduced.
The starting and arriving were at the most convenient
hours the distance and circumstances, with
reference to the passage of the two rivers, Severn
and Medway, would permit. The coach had to run
over the flat parts of the ground at a great pace, to
make up for time lost at the hills. The contract
time was 9 miles 2 furlongs in the hour.</p>

<p>One of the chief mail coaches in the kingdom in
1837 was the Bristol, Carmarthen and Milford (150
miles <i>vi&acirc;</i> Passage, one hour allowed for ferry),
Cardiff and Swansea. Its down journey occupied
19 hours 38 minutes, and its up journey 20 hours.</p>

<p>The Liverpool and Milford mails were conveyed
across the Severn at Aust Passage, where the ferry
had been located since the Lord Protector's time.
A moderate expenditure on the piers at Aust
Passage, though little regarded by the citizens at<!--[68.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the time the work was in progress, with the introduction
there of a steam vessel, was one of the
principal means of bringing about the establishment
of the additional communication with the
districts over the Severn, the uncertainty and inconvenience
of crossing its estuary being then
to a large extent removed.</p>

<p>Mr. Oliver Norris, now nearly 80 years of age,
and who has lived in the district adjoining the
Severn Tunnel from his boyhood, can call to mind
the time when the Liverpool and Milford coaches
were running. They had to make their way from
Pilning through Northwick, up to the Old Passage
at Aust, and in rough weather the passengers must
have had a cold ride on the bleak river banks over
which they had to journey. When the Bristol and
South Wales Railway was opened in 1863, the Aust
Passage was abandoned, and the ferry steamers
commenced to cross from the revived New (or
Pilning) Passage, to connect with the new train
services at Portskewet. When the penny post was
introduced, Mr. Morris says that as the coaches
passed through the villages the inhabitants in his
district adopted a primitive way of posting their<!--[69.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
letters, which was to place the letter and penny in
a cleft stick, and so hand up to the mail guard as
the coach was driven by, and who, if the penny was
not forthcoming, promptly threw the letter to the
ground.</p>

<p>The mail coach system was attended with many
adventures. Mr. Moses James Nobbs, the last of
the mail coach guards, recounted in the history of
his career how, in the winter of 1836, when guard
of the Bristol to Portsmouth coach, there were
terrible snow-storms towards Christmas time, and
many parts of the country were completely blocked.
After leaving Bristol one night at 7 p.m. all went
well until the coach was nearing Salisbury, at about
midnight. Snow had been falling gently for some
time before, but after leaving Salisbury it came
down so thick and lay so deep that the coach had
to be brought to a standstill, and could proceed no
further. Consequently Nobbs had to leave the
coach and go on horseback to the next changing
place, where he took a fresh horse and started for
Southampton. There he procured a chaise and
pair, and continued his journey to Portsmouth,
arriving there about 6 p.m. the next day. He was<!--[70.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
then ordered to go back to Bristol. On reaching
Southampton on his return journey the snow had
got much deeper, and at Salisbury he found that
the London mails had arrived, but could not go
any further, the snow being so very deep. Not to
be beaten, he took a horse out of the stable, slung
the mail bags over his back, and pushed on for
Bristol, where he arrived next day, after much
wandering through fields, up and down lanes, and
across country&mdash;all one dreary expanse of snow.
By this time he was about ready for a rest. But
there was no rest for him in Bristol, for he was
ordered by the mail inspector to take the mails on
to Birmingham, as there was no other mail guard
available. At last he arrived at Birmingham, having
been on duty for two nights and days continuously
without taking his clothes off. For his exertions
and perseverance in getting the mails through Mr.
Nobbs received a special commendation from the
Postmaster-General.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Nobbs tells that one night when the Bristol
coach was between Bath and Warminster, two men
jumped out of the hedge; one caught hold of the
leaders, and the other the wheelers, and tried to stop<!--[73.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<!--[72.png]-->
the coach. The coachman, immediately whipped up
the horses, and called out, "Look out! we are going
to be robbed!" Mr. Nobbs took the blunderbuss
out of the arms case (which was a box just in front
of the guard's seat); but, just as he did so, he saw
the fellows making towards the hedge, and then lost
sight of them altogether. To let them know that
he was prepared, he fired off into the hedge. He
didn't know whether he hit anything, but he heard
no cries or groans. The recoil of the blunderbuss,
however, nearly knocked him off his seat. The
blunderbuss, he said, kicked like a mule. It had
no doubt been loaded to the muzzle, as was usual
with those weapons. In the memorable storm of
Christmas, 1836, alluded to by Mr. Nobbs, the
Bath and Bristol mail coach, due in London on
Tuesday morning, was abandoned eighty miles from
the metropolis, and the mails taken up in a post-chaise
and four by the two guards, who reached
St. Martin's-le-Grand at 6.0 on the Wednesday
morning. For seventeen miles of the distance
the guards had from time to time to go across
the fields to get past the deep snowdrifts.</p>

<p>In the annual procession of mail coaches round<!--[74.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
London, at the head thereof was "the oldest
established mail,"&mdash;the Bristol mail, probably with
Guard Nobbs in charge. Some twenty-seven to thirty
coaches took part in the procession thus headed.
The old mail guards had a literature of their own.
As an example, one report on a guard's way-bill ran
as follows (it was a note to account for loss of time
on North Road):&mdash;"As we wos comin' over Brumsgroove
Lickey won of the leaders fell, and wen we
com to him he was ded."</p>

<p>One old fellow used to laugh, as the men said,
down in his boots, or like a pump losing its water.
Another used facetiously to say that he had better
than a dozen children. "Oh, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," said a
barmaid to him one day, "what can you do with so
many?" "Well, my dear," he replied, "you see
I've got but two, and they be, you must confess, a
good deal better than a dozen."</p>

<p>It is said that, with the exception of a single
instance, no guard was ever convicted of a breach of
trust while performing his duties.</p>

<p>In the year of Her Majesty's accession (1837)
there were no fewer than twenty-seven coaches
running daily between Bristol and London, and<!--[75.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
twenty-seven others passed between this city and
Bath every twenty-four hours. The times of the
London coach were as follow: London depart 8.0
p.m., Bath 7.21 a.m., Bristol arrive 8.43 a.m.,
depart 6.15 p.m., arrive G.P.O. 6.58 a.m.,&mdash;a slight
acceleration over 1830.</p>

<p>Where now is the fashionable roadside "Ostrich
Inn" on Durdham Down of a century ago, approached
by a rough and winding track from Black Boy Hill?
At this inn the coaches called on their way to the
Passage. Where now are the old four-horsed
coaches rattling up to "The Bush," "White Hart,"
and "White Lion" hostelries, and the old jolly dozen-caped
coachmen and scarlet-liveried mail guards,
with blunderbuss and horn? Where now the Bath
and Bristol mail pulling up at the roadside "King's
Head Inn"? The inns are gone, the coaches gone,
the jolly guards all gone too. What happiness their
smiling faces brought to many who watched for
their arrival by the mail coach from the West of
England, and how gladdening the sight of their
colonial mail bags to the merchants of the city and
to the sailors' wives looking out anxiously for the
monthly mail of those days! Though single-sheet<!--[76.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
letters cost 2s. 1d. each, what of that? Did they not
contain accounts of sugar and rum cargoes, and of
good news from absent ones. Letters were letters
in those days, and not the notes and cards and
"flimsies" of to-day.<!--[77.png]--></p>

<h5>VICTORIAN ERA, 1837-1899.<br /><br />

MAIL TRANSPORT BY RAILWAY.&mdash;TRAVELLING POST
OFFICES.</h5>


<p>Although the world's railway system was
inaugurated by the opening of the Stockton
and Darlington Railway in 1825, it was not until 1838
that any attempt was made by a great railway to
open up the traffic to the West from the Metropolis.
It was in that year that the Great Western Company
made a line between Paddington and Maidenhead,
and mails were sent by it. The section from Bristol
to Bath was opened in the same year. <i>Woolmer's
Gazette</i> of January, 1840, speaks of the 9.0 a.m.
"Exquisite" coach for Bristol, Cheltenham, Birmingham,
Manchester, and Liverpool, with part of
the service by rail. Intermediate sections of the
railway were completed from time to time, and,
finally, on the 30th January, 1841, the Western
line was opened throughout, and the coaches which<!--[80.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
had formed so striking a feature both of town and
country life generally disappeared. One coach,
however, obstinately held its ground in spite of the
railway, and continued to carry passengers from
and to London and Bristol at the rate of 1d. per
mile until October, 1843.</p>

<p>In consequence of the completion of the Great
Western Railway to Bristol, extensive mail alterations
had to be made, and they were commenced on
the 30th July, 1841, affecting the whole district
right through Somersetshire and Devonshire into
Cornwall. Some towns were made post towns and
others were reduced from the rank of post towns
to that of sub-post offices. To meet the altered
circumstances, revised sacking of bags had to be
resorted to. The instructions given by the President
to the staff in St. Martin's-le-Grand ended thus:</p>

<p>".... Any bags in addition to the ordinary
number must be reported to the road officers by the
clerks of the divisions, that they may be entered
under the head of 'extra,' also any agents or portmanteaus
for Falmouth; and they must instruct the
men carrying out the sacks and bags first to report
them to the check clerk, and then take them through<!--[81.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the letter carriers' office to the Devonport or Gloucester
omnibus, as the case may be, as the guards
will not for the future come into the office."</p>

<p>It was at this time that the villages of Hallatrow,
High Littleton, Paulton, Harptree (East and West),
Farrington Gurney, Temple Cloud, Cameley, and
Hinton Blewett were transferred from the postal
control of Bath to that of Bristol, under which they
still remain.</p>

<p>For several years the only trains carrying third-class
passengers from Bristol started at 4.0 o'clock
in the morning and 9.0 o'clock at night, offering the
travellers, who were wholly unprotected from the
weather, an alternative of miseries, and at first
travellers were not much better off in point of speed
when travelling by railway, as third-class passengers
were 9<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours on the railway between Bristol and
London. The coach at the time of its being taken
off performed the journey under 12 hours.</p>

<p>The "Bush" coach office was closed in March,
1844.</p>

<p>The Bristol and Gloucester Railway was opened
to the public on the 8th July, 1844. Of the seven
coaches which had been running between the two<!--[82.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
cities six were immediately withdrawn, and on the
22nd July the time-honoured "North Mail" left
Bristol for the last time, the horses' heads surmounted
with funereal plumes and the coachman
and guard in equally lugubrious array.</p>

<p>As late as 1845 Her Majesty's mails were conveyed
between Bristol and Southampton in a closed
covered cart, "proper for the purpose," as set forth
in an advertisement inviting tenders for a new
contract. The whole journey had to be performed
at the rate of eight miles within the hour, stoppages
included. The hours of despatch were:
From Bristol at about 6.0 p.m., and from Southampton
about 9.0 p.m.</p>

<p>In 1849 a great mail robbery took place, which
was committed with very much daring. The
robbers, who booked from Starcross station on the
1st January, left a compartment of the up night
mail train (which left Bridgwater at 10.30 p.m. and
reached Bristol at midnight); they crept along the
ledge, only 1½ inch wide, to the mail-brake at the
rear of the post office sorting carriage, and effected
an entrance, having previously possessed themselves
of a key of the lock. After having rifled the mail<!--[85.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<!--[84.png]-->
bags they crept back to their compartment, and
alighted from the train at the Bristol station, giving
up their tickets to the Great Western Railway
policeman. Not contented with robbing the up
mail, they got into the night mail train from
London to the West, which left Bristol at 1.15 a.m.,
and actually had the daring to pursue the same
tactics with regard to the mail bags in the locked
brake. This further audacity brought about their
capture, for the news of the robbery of the up mail
reached the ears of the officers at Bristol who were
in the down mail, and so they were on the alert.
On arrival, therefore, at Bridgwater the second
robbery was at once detected, all exit from the
station was stopped, and the train searched. Two
men were discovered in a first-class compartment
near the travelling post office, and registered letters
and money letters were found upon them. In
addition to the letters, masks, and false moustache
found, a woolstapler's hook, which it is supposed
was used by the thieves to hang on to the tender
when leaving the first-class carriage, was also discovered.
One of the registered letters stolen, it was
stated, contained &pound;4,000, and the loss, as far as it<!--[86.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
was known, unquestionably amounted to <i>fifty times</i>
that sum. The robbers turned out to be Henry
Poole, a discharged Great Western guard, and
Edward Nightingale, a London horse dealer. The
case excited a great deal of interest in the West of
England, and when the trial took place at Exeter
the court was crowded to excess, and the avenues
and approaches thereto were very inconveniently
crowded. Mr. Rogers, Q.C., and Mr. Poulden
appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Slade, Mr.
Cockburn, Q.C., and Mr. Stone defended.</p>

<p>Evidence was given by clerks in the Lombard
Street Post Office, messengers and letter-carriers in
the G.P.O., "register" clerks, clerk at Charing Cross
Post Office, the clerk of the Devonport Road, guard
of the mail from St. Martin's-le-Grand to Paddington,
and by letter-sorters in the travelling Post
Office. Jane Crabbe, barmaid at the "Talbot Inn,"
Bath Street, Bristol, recollected the two men entering
the bar and calling for two small glasses of brandy-and-water.
They were shown to an adjoining room,
where they remained until 1 o'clock, and then went
to the bar to pay. They appeared impatient, and
looked at the clock. It was suspected that all the<!--[87.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
property which, had been abstracted from the up mail
was secreted somewhere in Bristol, and a most rigid
search was instituted, but without success. Mr.
Cockburn's speech to the jury for the defence occupied
over two hours. Lord Justice Denman, the Judge
of the Spring Assize, sentenced the culprits to
fifteen years' transportation.</p>

<p>A Select Committee was appointed in 1854 to
inquire into the causes of irregularity in the conveyance
of mails by railways, and to consider the best
means of securing speed and punctuality; also to
consider the best mode of fixing the remuneration of
the various Railway Companies for their services.
The local witnesses, Mr. James Creswell Wall and
Mr. J. B. Badham, Secretary and Superintendent
respectively of the late Bristol and Exeter Railway
Company, and Bristol residents, gave evidence before
the Committee, composed of Mr. Wilson Patten
(chairman), Mr. James MacGregor, Mr. H. G. Liddell,
Mr. H. Herbert, Mr. C. Fortescue, Mr. Cowan, Mr.
Thompson, Mr. Philipps, and Mr. Milner.</p>

<p>Replying to questions, witnesses considered two
hours forty minutes, as fixed by the Post Office Department,
insufficient time for the down night mail to<!--[88.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
travel from Bristol to Exeter, including six stoppages.
The delivery of mail bags at certain stations by
apparatus without stopping the train was suggested,
but witnesses considered the plan dangerous and
that it could not with safety be adopted.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the South Wales Railway
Company, Mr. F. G. Saunders, gave evidence as to
the frequent loss of time sustained by the South
Wales night mail through the late receipt of the
Bristol and West of England mails at Chepstow.
At that time the bags for South Wales were still
conveyed from Bristol to the Aust Passage, thence
by ferry to the opposite bank of the Severn and on
to Chepstow. The conveyance of mails for South
Wales <i>vi&acirc;</i> Gloucester was subsequently adopted.</p>

<p>All the witnesses complained of the reduction of
railway parcel traffic through the then recent establishment
of book postage and consequent falling off
of receipts, also that the remuneration awarded for
the carriage of mails was insufficient, although
decided by mutually-appointed umpires.</p>

<p>For many years the night mails were conveyed
between Paddington and Bristol by a special train,
which did not carry passengers. It was the only<!--[91.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<!--[90.png]-->
train of its kind in the kingdom, but so useful was
it held to be in securing a regular delivery of letters
that the Government introduced a clause in a Postal
Bill in 1857 rendering it compulsory for all railways
to provide similar trains. On the 1st June, 1869,
the Post Office special Great Western train commenced
to be a mail train limited to carry a certain
number of passengers, so that opinion had by that
time become altered as regards the value in relation
to cost of a train exclusively for Post Office
purposes.</p>

<p>The travelling Post Office service assists greatly in
the speedy distribution of letters, and by its agency
remote places are put on an equality with the
country generally in respect of deliveries and
despatches. Two of the most important travelling
Post Office systems in the kingdom are conducted
through, or to, Bristol&mdash;the gate to the Western
country&mdash;viz.: The Great Western Railway, with a
travelling Post Office annual mileage of 500,000;
and the Midland and North-Eastern lines from
Newcastle, with a mileage of 220,000. Travelling
Post Offices, with a combined coach length of from
48 feet on the day mails to 158 feet on the night<!--[92.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
mails, are attached to the Great Western down
trains which arrive at Bristol at 12.13 a.m. and
8.48 a.m.; to the up trains, at 12.45 a.m. and 3.0
p.m.; to the trains leaving Bristol for the West at
6.15 a.m. and 12.9 p.m., and for the North at 7.40
p.m. The Midland travelling Post Office carriages
are attached to the 5.40 a.m. inward train and to
the 7.0 p.m. outward train.</p>

<p>There is living at Midford, about fifteen miles
distant from Bristol, a gentleman (Mr. Coulcher)
who&mdash;now pensioned from the Post Office&mdash;was
the clerk in charge of the Midland Travelling Post
Office on its first run from Bristol to Derby in 1857.
He well recollects the night, and what impressed
it upon his memory more than anything else was
the fact that on reaching Bristol, after he and his
two subordinate clerks and his mail-guard (Samuel
Bennett) had made almost superhuman efforts to
get the work completed, he had to send 13,000
letters unsorted into the Bristol Post Office, there
to await despatch by day mails to towns in the West
of England, instead of going at once in direct
travelling Post Office bags by the connecting early
morning train.<!--[93.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>


<p>Samuel Bennett, the old mail guard mentioned,
and contemporary of Moses Nobbs, was frequently
injured on road and rail. In 1847 he was much
shaken when a Birmingham-to-Bath train by which
he was travelling ran off the line. A few years
later he nearly came to an untimely end, having
been regarded as dead after being much knocked
about when two trains between Bristol and Birmingham
collided. On that occasion, after he
recovered consciousness, he got together some of
his mail bags and carried them on to Bristol.</p>

<p>The <i>Gloucester Journal</i> said of the occurrence:&mdash;"Samuel
Bennett, the guard of the mail bags,
appeared dead when found, and was dreadfully cut;
but on recovering, he manifested great anxiety for
the bags. When the special train arrived in which
the wounded passengers were conveyed onward,
Bennett, with great courage, determined to take the
bags by this train, which was done."</p>

<p>And the <i>Bristol Mercury</i> wrote of him as follows:&mdash;"The
mail guard, Samuel Bennett, was very much
cut over the face and head, and bled profusely.
Happily, he was not rendered long unconscious or
disabled, and with a conscientious and self-denying<!--[94.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
attention to duty not often met with, he refused
any attention to his hurts until he had gathered
up the mutilated letter bags and their contents,
and made provision for bringing them on to this
city."</p>

<p>In the Bristol district there is a railway Post Office
apparatus station at Fishponds, on the Midland
Railway, bags being deposited thereat by the train
due at Bristol at 5.40 a.m., and taken up by the
train ex Bristol at 7.0 p.m. On the Great Western
Railway, the apparatus arrangement is in operation
at Flax Bourton, Nailsea, Yatton, and Hewish,
chiefly in connection with the 6.15 a.m. train ex
Bristol. It rarely happens that any failures
occur at Fishponds or Hewish, but vagaries of the
apparatus are more frequent at Yatton. About once
a year something or other goes wrong, the pouch
usually being dropped and carried along by the train,
with mutilation of the mail bags and a general
scattering of the letters. On the last occasion, after
the line had been searched up and down, the embankment
closely looked over, and the ground on the
other side of the hedge on the down side closely
scrutinized, all unavailingly, some two or three days<!--[95.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
after the accident a bundle of letters was picked up
which, such was the force of the impact, had been
"skied" into a field over two hedges of an intervening
lane.</p>

<p>On another similar mishap, a Post Office remittance
letter containing &pound;20 in gold was burst open
and the coins scattered over the line. After diligent
search in every direction, &pound;18 10s. was recovered.
One half sovereign, bent in an extraordinary manner,
was found between the metals three-quarters of a
mile from the apparatus standard. The apparatus
has to be adjusted with mathematical nicety, and
if not so arranged failures are liable to occur. It
is well that the public should bear in mind that
packets sent by mails which are exchanged by
apparatus are in more or less danger, and any
article of a fragile or costly nature should, if possible,
be forwarded by mails carried by stopping-trains.
The places so affected in this neighbourhood are:&mdash;Alveston,
Bitton, Blagdon, Burrington, Clevedon,
Congresbury, Downend, Fishponds, Flax Bourton,
Frampton Cotterell, Frenchay, Glastonbury, Hambrook,
Hewish, Iron Acton, Langford, Mangotsfield,
Nailsea, Oldlands Common, Portishead, Pucklechurch,<!--[96.png]-->

<p>Until lately mails for Bristol were forwarded by
the midnight train from Euston (L. &amp; N. W. R.)
and reached this city by way of Birmingham in
time for the North mail delivery. It was on that
railway that in 1890 a sad occurrence happened at
Watford, when a young man whilst in the discharge
of his duties as fireman lost his life. The deceased
was leaning over the side of his engine, which was
stationary, watching for the signals to be turned,
when the day mail train from London dashed by.
The travelling Post Office apparatus net which had
picked up a pouch at a point a few score yards away
was still extended and it struck the unfortunate
young man on the head, completely severing it from
the body. The poor fellow's cap was torn from his
head by the apparatus net and fell into the travelling
Post Office carriages with the mail pouches much to
the consternation of the travelling sorters, who found
evidence of the mutilation on the apparatus framework.
The net was only down for the short space
of ten seconds. The travelling officials first heard<!--[97.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
full details of the accident on their arrival at Tring,
where the train next stopped.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," writes Mr. A. W. Blake in
the <i>St. Martin's-le-Grand Magazine</i>, "the London
afternoon mail was made up at a provincial office
down West (Chippenham), and despatched to be
taken off by apparatus. All proceeded as usual up
to the actual point of transfer, when a strange thing
happened. Instead of falling soberly into the net,
the man in charge was astonished to see the pouch
leap high into the air and descend he knew not
whither. Search was carefully made along the
track of the departed train, but not a vestige of
the missing pouch could be seen, and a local
inspector who was travelling up the line promised
to keep a look-out for it. Just at this time an 'S.G.'
was received from the officer in charge of the sorting
tender notifying the non-receipt of the pouch. As
the mystery seemed to deepen, word was received
that a signalman at a level crossing two miles away
had noticed the missing article on the top of the
train. Quoth the worthy apparatus man: 'If it'll
ride two miles, it'll ride two hundred'; and accordingly
a wire was sent to the sorting-tender people<!--[98.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
asking them to search the top of the train, and soon
came the reply that the pouch had been found on
the roof of the guard's van at Didcot. The train
had stopped the regulation time at that hub of the
Great Way Round, Swindon, and proceeded on its
way without the extraordinary position of Her
Majesty's mails being discovered."</p>

<p>The occurrence was attributed to the swaying of
the carriage, and to the apparatus-net not working
quite steadily in consequence.</p>

<p>At a later period than the mishap narrated by
Mr. Blake, the bags for Oxford and Abingdon, due
to be picked up at Wantage by the up night mail
travelling Post Office apparatus, and to have been
delivered by the same process at Steventon, were
not found when the net was drawn in, and it was
thought they had been missed; but at Didcot it
was discovered they had been thrown over the end
of the net and were hanging outside it.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1883
it has not often been found an absolute necessity to
make use of it for the conveyance of mails diverted
from the route from South Wales through Gloucester
to London; but such was the case in February of<!--[99.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the present year (1899), when a tidal wave of forty
feet was experienced in the Bristol Channel,
which caused serious damage by displacing the
railway line between Lydney and Wollaston.
The effects of the high tide were disastrous. A
wave dashed on to the Great Western Railway with
huge force, and so disintegrated the ballasting of
the permanent way that the lines were twisted into
all manner of shapes. The mails to and from
Paddington to South Wales were circulated <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Bristol and the Tunnel for some time.</p>

<p>Bristol is at a disadvantage as compared with
London in respect of its Continental correspondence,
but is far better situated than many other provincial
towns. The letters from the Continent by night
mails reach Bristol by the train leaving London at
9.0 a.m. and, arriving at Temple Meads at 11.57 a.m.,
are on delivery in the private box renters' office
at about 12.30 p.m. The postmen start out with the
letters at 1.10 p.m. As the hour of posting for the
outward Continental night mails is 2.10 p.m., it is
only the private box renters who have time, brief
though it be, to reply to their correspondence on the
day of receiving it.<!--[100.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>


<p>An appeal to the Hon. Member for Bristol East
was made by the writer at a Chamber of Commerce
dinner to exercise his influence as a director of the
Great Western Railway in the direction of obtaining
the use of a goods train for the conveyance to Bristol
of a midnight mail from London. In the end the
Railway Company afforded the Post Office the means
of bringing down a midnight mail, not by goods
train as was originally contemplated, but by new
and fast passenger train, with the result that half a
million letters a year now fall into the first delivery
throughout the town, instead of into the second
delivery as heretofore. The letters posted in London
up to 9.0 p.m. reach the head office in Small Street in
time to be delivered throughout the city and suburbs
by the postmen on their first round. Under the old
system, when "routed" <i>vi&acirc;</i> Birmingham, the arrival
was often so late and irregular that the letters missed
even the second delivery. The letters for the rural
districts having no day mail deliveries had to lie at
Bristol for twenty-four hours, while now they are
delivered on the morning of receipt from London.
The advantages o&pound; the new system apply to parcels
as well as letters, and the acceleration in delivery<!--[101.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
is particularly serviceable as regards parcels containing
perishable articles.</p>

<p>The Railway Company recently gave the Department
another opportunity of improving the mail
services by establishing a merchandise train from
Cornwall and the West to London, reaching the
Metropolis in time for the letters sent by it to be
delivered some three or four hours earlier than when
conveyed by the first passenger train in the morning.
Strangely enough, the establishment of this new
mail service was the means of enabling the hon.
baronet (Sir W. H. Wills), the Member for Bristol
East, to take his seat in the House of Commons
on the day of his last election, for the writ and
return were sent by that mail to London in time to
reach the Crown Office for all formalities to be gone
through in connection with the seat being taken at
once.<!--[102.png]-->

BRISTOL POSTMASTERS.</h5>


<p>Official records at St. Martin's-le-Grand show
that postmasters of Bristol were appointed as
follows; viz., Thomas Gale, 1678; Wm. Dickinson,
1690; Daniel Parker, 1693; Henry Pine, September,
1694; Thomas Pine, senior, 1740; Thomas Pine,
junior, 16th January, 1760; William Fenn, 1778;
Mrs. Fenn, 1788; Mr. Fry managed the office for
Mrs. Penn from 1797 to December, 1805, when he
died, and Mrs. Fenn retired on an allowance in 1806;
Mr. Cole, March, 1806, died whilst holding office;
John Gardiner, 9th June, 1825; Thomas Todd
Walton, senior, 21st February, 1832; Thomas Todd
Walton, junior, 23rd May, 1842, succeeded his
father; Edward Chaddock Sampson, 21st June, 1871;
Robert Charles Tombs, 19th April, 1892, after
having been invalided from Controllership of the
London postal service.</p>

<p>In his history of the Post Office, Mr. Joyce tells
us that in 1686 the Postmaster-General himself<!--[103.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
settled applications for salary. Thus when Thomas
Gale, postmaster of Bristol, applies for an increase
of salary, Frowde the governor satisfies the Earl of
Rochester, the Postmaster-General, that the increase
will be proper. Forthwith issues a document, of
which the operative part is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are therefore of opinion that the said salary
(&pound;50) is very small considering the expense the
petitioner is att, and his extraordinary trouble,
Bristoll being a greate Citty, but you say that you
doe not think all the things he setts downe in the
aforesaid accompt ought to be allowed him, the
example being of very ill consequence, for (as you
informe me) you doe not allow either candles, pack-thread,
wax, ink, penns or paper to any of the
postmasters, nor office-rent, nor returns of mony,
you are therefore of opinion that tenn ponnds
per annum to his former salary of &pound;50 will be a
reasonable allowance, and the petitioner will be therewith
satisfied, these are therefore to pray and require
you 'to raise his salary from &pound;50 to &pound;60 accordingly.'</p>

<p>The office of postmaster was in the hands of the
Pine family, grandfather, father, and son, from
1694 till 1778. In an old manuscript in the public
library it is stated that there was a portrait in the
possession of a descendant of the family, then residing
on Kingsdown, representing the older Pine in the
midst of his official duties, a bracket supporting a
bust of Mercury, and
in his hand a letter
thus addressed:&mdash;"On
His Majesty's
Service. To Mr.
Pine, Postmaster of
Bristol," and in the
corner, "P. Express.
T. Strickland." Endeavours
to trace the
descendants and the
portrait have proved
fruitless.</p>

<p>There is little

Gardiner, of whom it is related that, born October<!--[105.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
15th, 1777, he held the office of postmaster
of Bristol from 1825 till his death in 1832.
It is believed that he obtained his appointment
in a great measure through friendship
with Mr. Francis Freeling. Mr. Gardiner had to
bear the brunt of the Bristol Riots (1831), in so far
as they affected the Post Office administration of the
city. In order to save the mails and belongings
which were portable, such as the books, post dating
stamps, etc., he set off with them in a coach and four
for Bath Post Office. He got safely through the
mob and reached Bath, where the Bristol Post Office
business was carried on until the riots had been
quelled. Mr. Gardiner, in addition to being postmaster,
was also an exporter of woollen and
Manchester goods, chiefly to the West Indies until
the slave trade was abolished. He then traded with
Newfoundland. He was High Sheriff of the city
in the year 1820, residing at that time in Berkeley
Square. Later, however, he was enabled to live
quietly at the Old Manor House, Easton-in-Gordano.
He was buried at St. Peter's Church, Bristol.</p>

<p>Mr. Anthony Todd, the Secretary to the Post
Office, 1762-65 and 1768-98, seems to have been<!--[106.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
attracted to Todd Walton, of Cheshunt, Herts, either
by relationship or from his name, and took him in
hand. Born in 1772, Mr. Todd Walton entered the
Post Office in 1786 (fourteen years old). He had
the long spell of service of forty-six years in the
foreign Post Office
and ten years as
postmaster of
Bristol. He was
five times selected
for foreign missions,
which compelled his
residence in Holland,
Sweden, Spain, and
Portugal during the
most disturbed state
of those countries.
Mr. Walton is
described as having
been a fine old
English gentleman, one of the olden time, who wore
hair powder, blue coat with gilt buttons, and shoes
and gaiters; one who used to express his meaning
distinctly, and mean what he said too. This description<!--[107.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
is borne out by his appearance in his portrait.
He used to visit the Bristol Post Office after his
retirement, especially to have a morning glass of
water from the old well on the premises. He died in
July, 1857, at his residence, King's Parade, Clifton,
in his eighty-fifth year, and was buried in the adjacent
church of St. John's. On his tombstone is this
inscription: "Here rests the body of Thomas Todd
Walton, late of Cheshunt, Herts, and of the foreign
post, London, Esquire. A quarter of a century an
inhabitant of this parish, and for some years head
postmaster of the Bristol district. Deceased 13th
July, 1857. Aged 85. Also of Catherine Elizabeth,
his wife, elder daughter of Thomas Todd, of Durham,
Esquire. She died April 11th, 1860, aged 77 years."</p>

<p>On Mr. Walton's retirement, in 1842, in view of
his services, Lord Viscount Lowther, the Postmaster-General
of the day, conferred the appointment of
postmaster of Bristol on his son, Thomas Todd
Walton, who had been employed as chief clerk in
the Bristol Post Office for ten years. Mr. Todd
Walton, it seems, was properly initiated into the
mysteries of the Post Office art by his father, who
decreed that he should commence at the bottom of<!--[108.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the ladder and work his way up thence, so that
young Todd Walton was in his day to be found at
mail-bag opening, letter sorting and other routine
work of the kind, which will account for the thorough
knowledge of his
business which he
is said to have
possessed when
called upon to take
the reins of office
handed over to him
by his popular
parent.</p>

<p>In connection with
the recent selection
of the port of Bristol
as a mail station,
alluded to in later
pages, it may be
mentioned that Mrs.
Todd Walton well remembers how, when the
<i>Great Western</i> steamship, which carried the American
mails between Bristol and New York for several
years, was first due (1838) to reach this port, her<!--[109.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
husband organised his small staff for a night
encounter with the pressure of work which the
heavy mail would inevitably occasion, and obtained
auxiliary aid. The little staff was at "attention"
for two or three days, and when the news
came by means of the runner from Pill that the
ship was coming up the Avon, Mr. Walton turned
out at 2 a.m., rallied his little band, and went
manfully to the work, which lasted for many hours
before the letters were fully sorted and sent off to
their respective destinations or delivered through the
streets and lanes of the old city. In the autumn of
1841 the <i>Great Western</i> happened to arrive on the
same day that a large ship mail from Australia by
the <i>Ruby</i> was received, and the whole staff available&mdash;then
only ten men for all duties&mdash;had to work
night and day continuously to get off the letters by
the mails to other towns. As many as 20,000 letters
and newspapers were brought by these two vessels
on that occasion. It is recorded that every available
space in the premises was filled with letters piled as
high as they could be got to stand, and great was
the joy of the sorters when the flood of letters
subsided.<!--[110.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>


<p>Mr. Todd Walton had many other night reminders
of the mail services besides those respecting the
arrival of direct mails from America, as the rattling
of the horses' hoofs, the clang of the pole-chains and
the twang of the mail guard's horn as the coaches
dashed past his house on their way to the passages
must have frequently reminded him of his responsibilities
as "mail master" of Bristol. He would
have blessed Bristol's very able General Manager of
the Tramways Company had he been to the fore in
those days to procure the benefit of freedom from
the noise of traffic by the use of wood paving in our
principal thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Mr. Todd Walton had the interests of the staff of
the Post Office at heart, and, as an exemplification
of his sympathy with them, it may be mentioned that
when a promising officer in the heyday of youth
met with an accident which eventually necessitated
the amputation of his right leg, Mr. Walton did
not allow the misfortune to stand in the way of the
young man's continuing in remunerative employment
in the Post Office, but found for him a suitable
sedentary duty which he performed for fourteen
years.<!--[111.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>


<p>Mr. Todd Walton the second counted amongst
his contemporaries and personal friends those Post
Office literary stars, Anthony Trollope and Edmund
Yates.</p>

<p>Mr. Walton retired from the Post Office in 1871.
His death occurred at the Clifton Down Hotel on
the morning of Christmas day, 1885. He was in
the act of dressing to attend the early morning
service at All Saints' Church, when he fell into a
fit of apoplexy, from which he did not rally. The
<i>Times and Mirror</i> of January 2nd, 1886, gives the
following memoir of him:&mdash;"The death of this
estimable gentleman calls for more particular notice
than the necessarily brief one given in last Saturday's
impression; for although Mr. Walton had for
some time past ceased to be a citizen of Bristol, he
continued to feel an interest in the old city and its
surroundings, and was remembered by many Bristolians
as one who had obtained, as he deserved,
their affectionate esteem. Succeeding his father&mdash;a
gentleman of the 'old school'&mdash;as postmaster of
Bristol, Mr. Todd Walton, through the long series
of years in which he occupied that public position,
evinced unwearied industry, keen intelligence, and<!--[112.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
singular courtesy in discharging the multifarious
duties connected with it, and when on his retirement
(carrying with him into private life the respect
of his fellow-citizens) he was called upon to fulfil
the duties of High Sheriff of Bristol, those duties
were discharged by him for two years successively
in a manner distinguished by great public spirit
and generous hospitality. He was a man of considerable
culture and taste, an extensive reader, and
a reader who, happily, remembered what he had
read. He possessed also a sense of humour and
a ready wit which made him an agreeable and
intelligent companion; whilst to those who enjoyed
his friendship he was ever a friend, courteous and
kind. Blessed with abundant means, he helped
without ostentation the poor and needy, many of
whom in our own city will share in the general
regret his loss has occasioned."</p>

<p>In the centre of the church garden at All Saints',
Clifton, stands a cross, which Mrs. Walton erected
in 1888 to the memory of her husband. It was
designed by Mr. J. L. Pearson, R.A. It is of
granite, and stands on three steps. In the centre
of the shaft is a figure of the Good Shepherd, and<!--[113.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
at the top are four sculptures, beautifully executed,
of the Annunciation, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection,
and the Ascension. Over these rises a
crocketed finial, and the whole is surmounted by a
cross. At the base are inscribed the words: "In
loving memory of Thomas Todd Walton, sometime
churchwarden of the Church of All Saints, and a
most generous benefactor to that church."</p>

<p>By the death of Edward Chadwick Sampson,
the next postmaster, which occurred at Clevedon,
December 7th, 1895, the Post Office lost one of its
most gentlemanly and genial pensioners.</p>

<i>Postmaster of Bristol, 1871-1891.</i><br />
<i style='font-size: small'>From a photograph by Mr. Abel Lewis, Bristol.</i>
</div>

<p>For many years postmaster of Bristol, Mr.
Sampson was well known throughout the city, and
held in high esteem by all with whom he was
brought into contact. He had a long service in
the postal department, dating, as it did, from 1837
to the last day of 1891. In 1837 he began his
connection with the Bristol Post Office. He went
to Manchester as chief clerk in 1865, but was away
only six years, and returned in 1871 to assume the
postmastership of his native city. It is interesting,
as showing the enormous increase in the postal
traffic, to recall the fact that when Mr. Sampson<!--[114.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
joined the Corn Street office in 1837 the premises
were only twenty feet square, there were only
fifteen clerks and postmen all told, and no one was
allowed to have his letters from the boxes whilst a
mail was being sorted.</p>

<p>For his wide experience, his ability, and high
integrity his work was greatly valued by leading
officials in the postal service; whilst his sincerity
and kindliness of disposition endeared him to
employ&eacute;s of every grade over whom he had
control.</p>

<p>As the postman came to Mr. Sampson's door one
morning, it was seen that the man was too ill
to discharge his duties. Mr. Sampson thereupon
begged the man to come into his house and rest,
and he himself, with the aid of his son, delivered
every one of the letters at its destination, afterwards
seeing the poor man safely home. That kind
act was indicative of Mr. Sampson's general consideration
for those over whom he ruled.</p>

<p>On the resignation of Mr. Sampson, it was
generally felt that he should not be allowed to retire
into private life without taking with him tangible
evidence of the goodwill and respect of those with<!--[117.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
<!--[116.png]-->
whom he had been associated. This feeling found
expression in a gratifying manner, and the services
he had rendered the commercial community during
his postmastership were gracefully recognised by
the Chamber of Commerce presenting him with an
address illuminated and engrossed on vellum.</p>

<p>Exactly at midnight on the last night of 1891
he was invited, as his last official act, to seal what
is known to Post Office employ&eacute;s as the "London
and Exeter T.P.O., going west"&mdash;that is, the mail
bag of the travelling Post Office bound for Exeter.
Mr. Sampson discharged the slight duty devolving
upon him, and received the new year greetings of
his former colleagues, "Auld Lang Syne" being
afterwards sung.<!--[118.png]-->

<h5>NOTABLE POST OFFICE SERVANTS OF<br /><br />
BRISTOL ORIGIN.</h5>


<p>Probably the most illustrious man of the Post
Office service who had Bristol for a birthplace
was Sir Francis Freeling. Sir Francis was born in
Redcliffe parish, Bristol, in 1764, and was educated
partly at Colston School and in part by the Master
of Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School. In an
ancient city record it is stated that he commenced
his official career as "an apprentice" at the Bristol
Post Office, where the combined results of his
education, probity, and talents were soon discovered.
On the establishment of the new system
of mail coaches in 1784, he was appointed to aid
the inventor, Palmer, in carrying his improvements
into effect. Two years later he was transferred to
the General Post Office, London, where, in course
of time, he successively filled the offices of Surveyor,
Principal and Resident Surveyor, Joint-Secretary,<!--[121.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<!--[120.png]-->
and Secretary from 1798-1836. In a debate in the
House of Lords, in 1836, the Duke of Wellington
stated that the English Post Office under Freeling's
management had been better administered than any
Post Office in Europe, or in any other part of the
world. He possessed "a clear and vigorous understanding
... and the power of expressing his
thoughts and opinions, both verbally and in writing,
with force and precision." For his public services
a baronetcy was conferred upon him on March
11th, 1828, a meet reward for his long, arduous,
and valuable services. He was a warm supporter
of Pitt, but he suffered no political partisanship
to affect his administration of the Post Office.
Freeling's leisure was devoted to the formation of
a curious and valuable library. He was elected a
Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1801, and
was one of the original members of the Roxburgh
Club, founded in 1812. He died while still at his
post on the business of the country which he had so
faithfully served, and was buried in the church of
St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol.</p>

</div>

<p>The inscription on the memorial tablet runs thus:
"To the memory of Sir Francis Freeling, Baronet,<!--[122.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
who was born in this parish the 25th August, 1764,
and who died in Bryanston Square, in the county of
Middlesex, the 10th July, 1836. For more than
half a century his life was devoted to the public
service in the General Post Office, in which for
thirty-eight years he discharged the arduous duties
of Secretary. By unwearied industry in the employment
of great talents, and by unblemished integrity,
grounded upon Christian principles, he acquired
and retained the favour of three successive
Sovereigns, and the approbation of the public.
He has left a name which will be remembered with
honour in his birthplace, and which is cherished
with affection and veneration by his children, who
have raised this monument."</p>

<p>Sir Francis Freeling was thrice married. By his
first wife, Jane, daughter of John Christian
Kurstadt, he had two sons. He was succeeded in
the baronetcy by the elder, Sir George Henry
Freeling, born in 1789, who matriculated at New
College, Oxford, 17th March, 1807, and was for
some time Assistant-Secretary at the Post Office,
and subsequently Commissioner of Customs (1836-1841).
There is a descendant of Sir Francis in the<!--[123.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
service, and the name may again be read of in Post
Office history.</p>

<p>The editor of <i>Felix Farley's Journal</i> (Mr. J. M.
Gutch), of 15 Small Street, Bristol, wrote many
letters on "the impediments which obstruct the
trade and commerce of the city and port of
Bristol," under the signature of "Cosmo," in the
years 1822-3. The letters were afterwards published
in book form, and the dedication was&mdash;"To
Francis Freeling, Esq., Secretary to the General
Post Office, F.A.S., etc., a native of Bristol, than
whom, whenever opportunity has occurred, no
citizen has exerted himself more in the promotion
of the public and private welfare of this city, the
following letters are dedicated, and this humble
opportunity gladly embraced of testifying the
obligations and sincere respect of his obedient
servant, <span class="smcap">The Author</span>."</p>

<p>A Postmaster-General has not emanated from our
western city, but Mr. Arnold Morley, late General-in-Chief,
is the son of one who worthily represented
Bristol in Parliament for many years, the late highly-respected
Mr. Samuel Morley, the legend on whose

face and form of one who was an example of justice,

that the power of England is to be reckoned not by
her wealth or armies, but by the purity and virtue
of the great men of her population."&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. Morley.</span></p>

<p>Although Sir Francis stands out pre-eminently,
there is a long list of Bristol officers who have gone
forth and gained Post Office laurels. First on that
honourable roll may be mentioned J. D. Rich, who,
over half a century ago, first hung up his hat in the
Bristol Post Office, a "furry" hat of the old stovepipe
kind, as he tells the story. Mr. Rich showed so
much ability in meeting the requirements of the times
at Bristol that he rose to the position of president
clerk. In 1848, on the recommendation of the Surveyor
General, he was removed to Bath, as peculiarly
fitted to assist Mr. Musgrave, who from his advanced
age was unequal to the duties, and the result was
apparent in a great improvement of the local
service. That Mr. Rich won golden opinions was
proved by a memorial for his appointment to<!--[125.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
succeed Mr. Musgrave, addressed to the Postmaster-General,
and signed in a short time by more than a
thousand citizens. The memorial was, however,
unavailing. Mr. Rich, after performing various
services under five other provincial postmasters,
found himself at last in the enviable position of
lord of postal matters in Liverpool, and Surveyor
of the Isle of Man. On retiring from the Service
recently, he was made a Justice of the Peace in
recognition of his distinguished services to the city.
Mr. Kerry, telegraph superintendent, became postmaster
of Warrington, Mr. Harwood of Southport,
Mr. Carter (chief clerk) of Southampton, Mr. Brown

Newton Abbot, Mr. Walton of Teignmouth, Mr.

for twenty years) of Swansea.</p>

<p>Several officers of the Bristol Post Office have
entered telegraph services abroad. Mr. J. Wilcox is

<h5>POST OFFICE BUILDINGS.</h5>


<p>There is record of a Post Office having been
established in Bristol by the Convention Parliament
in 1670, but the site is unknown, and
probably the postmaster had post horses&mdash;not
letters&mdash;to attend to. In the year 1700 Mr. Henry
Pine, the postmaster of the day, was one of the
parties to an agreement for leasing a piece of land
"with liberty to build upon the same for the conveniency
of a Post Office." The wording of the
said agreement shows that the old-fashioned form
of building was not in every instance (as it now
seems to us to have been) so grotesquely shaped
from fancy, or, perhaps, from a desire to economise
ground space, for it is therein expressly stated that
the building to be used for a Post Office was to
have the second storey extended to a truss of
eighteen inches over the lane, for the purpose of
enabling people to stand in the dry; for there was<!--[128.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
no indoor accommodation for the public provided in
those days. "Let the imaginative reader," wrote
an imaginative writer years ago, "picture to himself
our great-great-grandfathers in doublet and ruff,
standing in a row under the eighteen-inch truss,
while the worthy postmaster, Pine himself, with
perhaps one assistant, was sorting the contents of the
mail bag. Doubtless," wrote he, "they grumbled
when it rained that the said truss was not half
a dozen inches wider, and many a person as he
became saturated in his time of waiting for his
letters growled out his intention of doing something
very desperate to the powers that were."</p>

<p>In the "Bargain" books of the Corporation is
the following memorandum relating to the foregoing:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>22nd June, 1700.</i> Then agreed by the Surveyors
of the city lands with Henry Pine, deputy postmaster,
that he, the said Henry Pine, shall have,
hold, and enjoy the ground whereon now stands a
shedd having therein four severall shopp seituate
in All Saints' Lane, and as much more ground at
the lower end of the same shedd as that the whole
ground shall contain in length twenty-seven foot,<!--[129.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and to contain in breadth from the outside to the
churchyard wall five foot and a half outward into
the lane, with liberty to build upon the same for
conveniency of a Post Office (namely) The first
storey to go forth into the said lane to the extent
of that ground and no farther, and the second storey
to have a truss of eighteen inches over the lane or
more as the said Surveyors shall think fitt that
persons coming to the Post Office may have shelter
from the rain and stand in the dry. To hold the
same from Michaelmas next for fifty years absolute
in the yearly rent of 30s. clear of taxes...."</p>

<p>This agreement must have been afterwards
modified. For some reason or other, Pine paid
no rent until Michaelmas, 1705, when a sum of 25s.
was received by the Chamberlain, and "The post
house produced the same yearly sum until 1742
when the rent was raised to &pound;3."</p>

<p>The site of the little Post Office alluded to was
required in 1742 in connection with the building
of the Exchange, and the Post Office was transferred
to a house in Small Street, in later days
occupied as the printing office of the <i>Times and Mirror</i>
newspaper.<!--[130.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>


<p>There seems to have been some informal understanding
that when the Exchange was finished a
suitable site would be provided by the Corporation
for postal business, and in August, 1746, a Committee
reported to the Council that they had contracted for
the erection of "a house intended to be made use of
as a Post Office, certain workmen having agreed to
build and find all the materials at the rate of &pound;60
per square (<i>sic</i>); while Mr. Thomas Pine (nephew
to Henry, the former postmaster) had offered to
become the tenant at &pound;40 a year, which he alleged
is the highest rent he is able at present to pay."
The Council approved of the proposal, recommending
the Committee to get as much rent as was practicable.
The house, which was of scanty dimensions, cost
&pound;700 exclusive of a ground rent of &pound;15 a year given
for the site. Only the ground floor was set apart
for postal business, Mr. Pine residing on the
premises. The first year's rent (&pound;43) was paid in
1750. Between 1750 and 1815 the building must
have been considerably enlarged, for in the latter
year the Post Office is spoken of as a handsome
and convenient building of freestone, near to the
western end of the Exchange, to which it has a wing<!--[131.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
projecting forward into the street; and there is
another building, exactly similar to it, at the eastern
end, which is occupied for a stamp office. In 1827
there was a contemplated removal of the Post Office,
and it was deemed proper by the Chamber of
Commerce to come on the scene by presenting a
memorial to the Postmaster-General; it is stated that
the timely remonstrance no doubt contributed to
relieve the public of the inconvenience of such
removal. Colonel Maberly, the Secretary to the
Post Office, advised Lord Lichfield in 1838 that as
the ground-floor portion of the Post Office premises
occupied by the solicitors was necessary for the extension
and improved accommodation of the office, no
time should be lost in giving the several sub-tenants
notice to quit, and Mr. Hall or the postmaster
should be instructed to communicate with the
Corporation as to the means of effecting such
alterations as might be requisite. His lordship gave
authority to that effect. In 1839 the Corporation
granted the Government a new lease of the premises
and of additional ground behind for the purpose of
having the Post Office enlarged. The annual rent
previous to this new arrangement had risen to &pound;100.<!--[132.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>


<p>The building alluded to is that now rented by
Messrs. Corner and Co. as a tea warehouse. Few
indeed, even of the oldest citizens will remember
the Bristol Post Office as located there, and the old
square open public lobby where the letters were
given out through barred windows. Only the ground
floor was utilised, and the area, of the site was but
21 ft. by 20 ft. A door opened from the passage
by the Exchange into a very small public lobby.
In this lobby was the letter-box, and here all
business with the public&mdash;viz., giving out private
letters, taking in letters prepaid in money, and the
issuing and paying of money orders&mdash;was transacted
by clerks standing in the office behind a glass partition.
The prepayment of letters by means of
postage stamps was not introduced till some months
after penny postage was established. There was
not at the time a continuous attendance of clerks
at the glass partition. At two of the slides in the
partition there were small brass door-knockers, and
on the public knocking a clerk appeared; from the
inside office and attended to the wants of the
applicants. When letters for the private box renters
were being sorted a blind was drawn down. When<!--[133.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the mail was ready the blind was drawn up, and
three clerks attended to disperse the crowd which
had gathered during the half-hour or so while the
office was closed. The small space behind the
public lobby sufficed for the stamping, sorting, and
other necessary duties. One man, history saith,
amongst the crowd generally got to the front
without difficulty; he was a flour-dusted messenger
from the Welsh Back!</p>

<p>In 1847 the Money Order Department had
grown amazingly, and a separate room had to be
provided for its accommodation. This caused the
removal of certain solicitors from the first floor to
make room for the postmaster's office, the one
formerly held by him on the ground floor being
converted into a money order office. In 1855 the
shop on the north side of the entrance to Albion
Chambers from Small Street was taken by the
Post Office and converted into a money order office,
it being found that the department devoted to this
purpose at the general office in Exchange Buildings
was not sufficiently commodious or convenient.</p>

<p>It is on record that in 1863 the Post Office
authorities offered &pound;10,000 towards erecting a new<!--[134.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Post Office if the citizens would consent to contribute
&pound;2,000 more. A meeting of some gentlemen
took place in the committee-room of the Council
House to take the proposition into consideration,
but owing to the small number of persons that
attended further deliberation was postponed to a
day not named. Some of the leading citizens were
of opinion that it would be wise to defer any decision
on the subject until the intention of the Government
as to granting a criminal assize for Bristol was
known; for should the answer from head-quarters
be in the affirmative, it would be necessary to build
a new court somewhere, in which case the Guildhall
would perhaps suit as a Post Office. Nothing
appears to have come of the negotiations, and the
business of the Post Office was removed on the 25th
of March, 1868, to the new office erected in Small
Street on the site where it is now carried on. This
original portion of the structure covers 11,000
square feet. The purchase of the site was completed
on the 21st December, 1865. It is stated in
a legal document that the bricks, stones, and material
on part of the site belonged to the Bristol Chambers
Co. Limited. Where the sorting office stands there<!--[135.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
formerly flourished a fine mulberry tree. There
appears to have been no ceremonial in the way of
laying a foundation stone, and the antiquarian of the
distant future may be disappointed in not discovering
the usual coins deposited on such occasions.</p>

<p>In fifteen years the need arose for more space, and
that then the Bristol public manifested a keen interest
in the position of the Bristol Post Office was indicated
by an animated debate which took place in our
Council Chamber; and as this book affects to be in
part a history as well as a narrative, it is thought
well to give the report of the proceedings a full
record herein, under permission from the proprietors
of the <i>Bristol Times and Mirror</i>:&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Town Clerk</span> said that as the next part of
the report referred to the site for the Post Office, he
would read a letter he had received from Mr. Lewis
Fry, M. P., which was as under:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My dear Sir,&mdash;As I observe that the question
of the site of the new Post Office will come before<!--[136.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the Council on Thursday, I think it best, in order to
avoid any misunderstanding, to ask you to state to
the Council that the matter is not to be considered
as a proposal made by the Postmaster-General or the
first Commissioner of Works. The exact position of
the matter is this, that Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, soon after
his visit to Bristol, requested me to intimate to the
Corporation that in case they desire the change of
situation to Baldwin Street, he is ready to entertain
any proposal which they may make to him with that
object, provided it be upon the basis of an exchange
of properties as mentioned in the report of the
Finance Committee.</p>

<p>
"'I am, yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">Lewis Fry</span>.<br />
The Town Clerk of Bristol.'<br />
<br /></p>


<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> said he would like to say a word
or two on the subject of a new Post Office, as the
wording in Mr. Fry's letter referred to the subject
of the proposed change in the position of the Post
Office. They did not want change for change's
sake (applause), and if they could do without it
they would be glad to do so, but sometimes change
became a necessity (applause). He would wish to<!--[137.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
say a word or two with reference to the provisions
for the postal arrangements in Bristol, as to the
inconvenience that the officials and the public were
subject to, and a word as to the great increase in
postal matters in the city and in the country generally.
He wished to convey to them the magnitude of the
question and the very growing character of the
communications by letters, parcels, and newspapers,
which were being circulated through the medium of
the Government and through the Post Office. He
the previous day called upon Mr. Sampson, the head
official of the Bristol Post Office, and he might say
that his ability was only exceeded by his courtesy
(applause). He gave him all the information he had
asked for, and he showed him over a considerable
part of the building. In the course of the interview
he gave him no opinion as to the site, and he did
not think it wise to ask him. All he asked him, was
as to facts&mdash;as to the present accommodation. He
described the condition of the office as being one of
congestion, and that they were put to all kinds of
shifts, and that the sorting and minor offices were
inadequate for their respective purposes (hear, hear).
He saw a room where eighty postmen were engaged<!--[138.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
in partial sorting. It was upstairs and was approached
by winding stairs with only a 21-inch tread,
and the room was utterly inadequate for the purpose.
Letters had to be sent to Clifton to be sorted
because of the want of space in the Post Office.
Mr. Sampson said more particularly that a large hall
was necessary on the ground floor for an entrance,
from which the various subsidiary offices should be
entered. Then he said that a good frontage was
desirable. Some people had suggested tunnelling
and going to the other side of the street, and others
had suggested a viaduct. Offers of property had
come from different people, so that the want of
further accommodation seemed to be recognised not
only by the Post Office itself, but outside. The
present office was erected in 1868, and had the
officials been sanguine, or known that the business
would have increased as it had, they probably would
not have selected the present site. The work of the
office had perfectly outgrown the capacity of the
place. Since 1868 new departments had been
opened, and new duties had been created, and they
wanted more room. The telegraph work was added
in February, 1870, and the sale of revenue stamps<!--[139.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and payment of stamps as money had also been
added. The parcel post came into operation in 1883.
They did not desire an extravagant outlay. The
increase of the population was 1 per cent., and the
letters increased 3 per cent. They were not asked
to buy a whole street. He felt it would be admitted
that the telegraphic despatches formed the essential,
if not the primary, part of the arrangements of the
Post Office. He was informed that the site in
Baldwin Street was more convenient and closer to
the warehouses and offices which greatly used the
present telegraphic advantages than the present site
in Small Street (a voice: 'No'). Well, he gave his
word for what he had heard. He maintained that
the Council had a supreme moment at the present
time. They had a gentleman at the head of the
Post Office who had viewed the new site, and now
they found that the Post Office authorities were in
the humour to make the outlay they had better
embrace the opportunity. His resolution was:
'That, considering the want of adequate space in
Small Street for postal and telegraphic arrangements,
it is desirable that a new Post Office be
erected in Baldwin Street, on the site recently<!--[140.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
viewed by the Postmaster-General, if equitable
arrangements can be made with the Government for
the transfer of the property.' If the Government
were not prepared to lay out money for the site,
they could let them have the property on a ground-rent,
without an outlay being made. It would not
cost less than &pound;20,000 to &pound;25,000 to enlarge and
improve the present Post Office, and he maintained
that that sum would go a great way towards erecting
a new Post Office in Baldwin Street. They would
not always be able to get sites; and they could not
always buy sites as they could oranges and nuts
(laughter). In America people ran after him and
asked him to buy land. Not so here. He repeated
that they had Mr. Shaw-Lefevre looking favourably
upon the new site, and he thought it desirable that
they should take a bold step&mdash;such a step as
indicated in the resolution&mdash;and put up a building
which not alone should be noble, but commodious
(applause).</p>

<p>"Mr. Alderman <span class="smcap">Edwards</span> seconded the resolution.
He was glad that the matter had been laid before
the Postmaster-General. A great deal had been
said about the present site being more useful and<!--[141.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
convenient than the proposed, but he felt that the
difference was very small indeed. The sites were
within a minute or two of each other. In Baldwin
Street they had a road 60 ft. wide, and if Small
Street were altered, however much, they would not
widen it half as much as that. As to the positions
of the banks, some of the important ones were
nearer Baldwin Street than the other street. At
any rate, the Old Bank, Stuckey's, and the National
Provincial Banks were nearer Baldwin Street than
Small Street. The speaker then named several large
warehouses which were, he urged, closer to the
proposed site than Small Street. At Baldwin Street
they had an acre of ground for the present or future.
He would not give the land to the Post Office
authorities, but he suggested that they should be
liberal towards them in their offer. If the Post
Office authorities wished to give them the old office
in exchange for the site, it might be utilised by the
Corporation.</p>

<p>"Mr. C. <span class="smcap">Wills</span> supported the resolution. He
would advance one or two reasons why they should
make the best terms they could with the Postmaster-General.
That the present Post Office was inconveniently<!--[142.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
small was generally admitted, and he
maintained that if the proposed additions were made
to the existing building, the extra facilities would
not meet the ever-increasing demands on the Post
Office for more than six or eight years. The various
departments of the present building were too small
for development and carrying on the important work
of a Post Office. Personally, he would as soon for
the Post Office to be in one street as the other, but
he felt it would redound to the credit of the city
to see a fine building erected in Baldwin Street. If
they had the Post Office there it would enhance
the value of the other sites in the thoroughfare.
Very shortly they would have the sixpenny telegrams,
and then the increase in telegraphic communication
would be very great indeed, and the
present building would soon become inadequate to
the demand. Then, again, they saw that the
present Postmaster-General did not intend to give
up the parcels post, and the development of this
branch of the Post Office work would be very great
indeed. Then, again, there would be increased
vehicular traffic to the Post Office; and could this,
he asked, be carried out to the comfort of the<!--[143.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
citizens in Small Street? The turning point arose
from Mr. Shaw-Lefevre visiting the Chamber of
Commerce recently. That gentleman visited the
site in Baldwin Street, and he, no doubt, saw that
the site would be better and superior to the one
in Small Street.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Pethick</span> said that they had come to a
turning point in the history of the city of Bristol.
The question was whether they should continue
the system of compression that they had suffered
from for so many years. Small Street was a narrow
thoroughfare; it was only a back lane to Broad
Street. ('Oh! oh!') It was called Small Street
and had a carriage way of only 9 ft. ('No, no.')
He must repeat that at one point in Small Street
the carriage way was only 9 ft. wide.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> protested against Mr. Pethick
saying that Small Street was the back lane to
Broad Street, and that the carriage road was only
9 ft. (hear, hear). The narrow part of Small Street
would come down when the improvements to the
Post Office took place.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Pethick</span>: I state facts&mdash;what the street is
to-day.<!--[144.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>


<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>: But is the narrow part you speak
of the entrance to Small Street?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Pethick</span>: It is the approach from Bristol
Bridge, <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Exchange, for mail carriages and
other traffic, and all must pass through the narrow
part, which is only 9 ft. wide. Even if this were
taken away, Mr. Pethick continued, they would
still have a narrow space to pass through. The
whole would not be 14,000 superficial feet; and
above all, with so bad an access, they proposed to
enlarge the present building.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alderman <span class="smcap">Proctor Baker</span>: It is not
proposed.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Pethick</span> observed that in Baldwin Street
they had a good carriage way, and they would have
a front and back entrance to a new building. He
hoped no little or narrow parochial spirit would be
put forward in this matter. The difference of the
distance of the two sites was so small as to be
insignificant, and he trusted they would endeavour
to get a handsome and commodious building erected
on the Baldwin Street side of the city.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alderman <span class="smcap">Proctor Baker</span> said they were
indebted to Mr. Robinson for his interesting details,<!--[145.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
but he did not think they were details for the
Council to study, but for the study of the Government.
The Post Office was a Government undertaking,
and carried on for profit by the Government,
and it was on their shoulders, and theirs alone, to
provide proper premises. There were two questions
involved in the resolution before them, and if it
could be so arranged he should like a separate
opinion being taken. One question was the actual
position of the future Post Office&mdash;whether it was
to be in Small Street or Baldwin Street. The
other question was whether the Council was prepared
to sell to the Post Office the land in Baldwin
Street and receive in exchange the building in Small
Street. As regarded the question of convenience
there was very little to be said on either side; but
with regard to the other matter he thought they
should not agree to exchange the land for the
present Post Office building. If they took over
the existing building, it could only he pulled
or used for public offices. Already they had a
population of 200,000 persons, and the area of
the city was to be extended; and if they believed
in the progress of the city they must expect it<!--[146.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
by-and-by to be the centre of a quarter of a million
of people. It would be impossible, as it would be
discreditable, for them to attempt to carry on that
great municipality in such buildings as they now
had. The chamber in which they were assembled
was in a bad condition; the air at that moment was
as foul as it could be; and if they took over the
present Post Office and applied it for the purposes
of the municipality, they would perpetuate the
present discomfort, inconvenience, etc., of having
divided offices, and postpone for half a century the
erection of a large municipal building, in which
all their offices would be. As to Baldwin Street
and Small Street sites, there was much to be said
on both sides; but if it was proposed to take in
exchange the Post Office building for their land
the Council should vote against it (hear, hear).
He sincerely trusted they would not take over a
building which would keep up the inconvenience
they now suffered from (hear, hear).</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span> said it seemed to him that they were
simply asked the question whether the Council were
desirous that there should be such a change in the
position of the Post Office. Every argument for<!--[147.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the change was a thoroughly good one which should
weigh with them. Selfish considerations and every
consideration should be banished (applause), and
they should consider it in the interest of the city
and in the interest of the development of the trade
of the future. The opinion of the postmaster was
a great argument in favour of larger premises.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Inskip</span> argued that the representatives of
the ratepayers were not there to carry out the
bidding of the postmaster. It might be wise and
proper for him to communicate his views to the
department with which he was connected, but it
seemed unreasonable to ask members of the Council
to vote for what he was in favour of. He ventured
to suggest that the arrangement proposed by the
report would be unlawful, and to enter into the
exchange would be an unlawful proceeding. They
acquired land in Baldwin Street under the Public
Health Act for carrying out improvements, and he
could not see how it could be said that the buildings
in Small Street would be required for the purpose
of improvements. Before they entered into the
exchange they ought to obtain power by Act of
Parliament. If they entered into a speculation of<!--[148.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
that sort they would be transgressing the law of the
land. With regard to the matter of convenience, if
they took the outlying districts of the city they
would see that the people who lived there went to
the Post Office after the branch offices were closed,
and they would see that Small Street was appreciably
more convenient for the outlying population
than the Baldwin Street site could possibly be
(applause). Then as to the piece of land which
would be obtained, the argument of Mr. Pethick
was a strong one to retain it. The Guildhall was
there, and it had been promised for years that Small
Street should be improved, and that improvement
would be accomplished if the Government had
No. 3, Small Street, which would be set back, and
they would have done a great deal to redeem the
promise made some years ago (applause).</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Dix</span> said he was very much obliged to Mr.
Robinson for his figures. They all felt that there
had been a great growth in the postal arrangements
of the country, and that there would be a great
growth in the future; and if it had been shown to
him that they could not have a good building in
Small Street by having the one there altered by the<!--[149.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
authorities, and that they could have a proper one
in Baldwin Street, he would say let them go to
Baldwin Street; but it did not come before them
in that light. They were anticipating that the
postal authorities could not make a proper building
in Small Street; but he could not see how Mr.
Robinson and those who advocated the Baldwin
Street site came to such a conclusion. If they had
the buildings in Small Street, that street would be
improved, which had been anticipated for years,
and they would have the Post Office close to the
Guildhall and that great place of commerce&mdash;the
Commercial Rooms (applause). He argued that the
city did not want the property in Small Street&mdash;it
would be useless to them; and he hoped they would
pronounce against it going forth to the Postmaster-General
that it was the wish of the Council to alter
the site (applause).</p>

<p>"Mr. S. G. <span class="smcap">James</span> said he did not think that they
should be saddled with a building that would not
be any good to them. He suggested that it should
be represented to the Government that the building
would be a good one for a Stamp and Excise Office,
and that it would be convenient to have those offices<!--[150.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
moved from Queen Square to the building in Small
Street. He thought that would be a very wise
suggestion to make to the Government.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> said he viewed the proposition to
shift the Post Office as one of the most solemn and
weighty that had been considered by the Town
Council for years (hear, hear). By common consent,
and by the development of the city trade, where the
Post Office now was the centre of commerce,
and they should hesitate very much before they
changed it (hear, hear); and the Council, being
trustees of the property owned by the city, and
looking at the extent of that property in the neighbourhood
of the Post Office, and the outlay made
on it by the city, he could not understand why
they made the suggestion to run away from Small
Street (applause). They had under arbitration paid
to the bank &pound;9,600 for a piece of land, and that
was surely not to keep the street as a narrow lane.
If the present Post Office were retained, the
authorities would take the houses that would be
put in a line with the Post Office, and two-thirds of
Small Street would be converted into a wide street&mdash;and
it was only to shave off the Water Works<!--[151.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
offices and adjoining building, and then they would
have a good wide street (hear, hear). The Corporation
during the last twenty years had spent in the
neighbourhood not less than &pound;50,000, and if by
establishing the Post Office in Baldwin Street they
would enhance the value of the adjoining property,
so taking it away from the centre of the city would
depreciate the property there. It would not be
doing justice to the citizens to take it away from
Small Street and remove it to a remote spot like
Baldwin Street. ('Oh, oh!' and laughter.) It was a
remote spot, and he did not know that a street
through which were a tram line and continual cab
traffic was the best place for a Post Office. He
believed a quiet street would be the better place.
He farther argued that the proper place for the
Post Office was where it was&mdash;in the neighbourhood
of the Assize Courts, where the County Court was
held all the year round, and the assizes and sessions
were held, and at the back of the Commercial
Rooms, to which there were upwards of 600
subscribers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alderman <span class="smcap">Naish</span> said that what weighed
with him was that the Government had not applied<!--[152.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
for a better site. He apprehended that Mr. Shaw-Lefevre
was perfectly satisfied with the accommodation
he could get on the present site. He had
seen the draft of the Bill promoted by the Government
for taking possession of a building under the
compulsory powers at a fair valuation. Someone in
Bristol wished them to go somewhere else. All
Mr. Shaw-Lefevre said was that if the citizens
wanted to go elsewhere they must take the old
building. The Postmaster-General did not suggest
the removal, but somebody else did (hear, hear).
The Postmaster-General knew his business, and he
probably considered that the present office could be
enlarged so as to provide all the accommodation
necessary. They could thus have a good public
improvement in the centre of the city, and at the
same time provide for the postal requirements.
They were simply asked to go to a street in which
certain people were interested, which, although a
large thoroughfare, had two lines of tramways
running through it. He hoped the Council would
not agree to the proposal.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Matthews</span> said if the question was put to
them simply, did they require more postal accommodation?&mdash;they<!--[153.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
would unhesitatingly say that
they did; but the question of site was a totally
different matter. They had not gone into the
question whether another site would not be a
better one than the Baldwin Street one. He
moved that the question of a site be remitted to
a committee, with instructions to report to the
Council, and that the committee consist of the
Mayor, Aldermen Spark, Harvey, and Naish, and
Messrs. Townsend, C. F. Hare, Barker, and Inskip.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Levy</span> considered that the city was indebted
to those who suggested the Baldwin Street site.
There could be no two opinions about the matter
(cries of 'Oh,' and laughter). They had seen an
amusing correspondence in the papers about it. He
would not do anything to injure the <i>Times and Mirror</i>
for a moment (laughter). In Baldwin Street a Constitutional
Club had been established, and the <i>Times
and Mirror</i> might consider that institution (laughter).</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Whitwill</span> thought they should simply confine
themselves to an expression of opinion as to the
desirability of Baldwin Street site, for he should be
strongly opposed to the exchange (hear, hear).</p>

<p>"Mr. H. G. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span> said the position in Small<!--[154.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Street was preferable to him, but they ought to sink
personal convenience. The Chamber of Commerce
suggested the matter, and he looked on that body
as young Bristol.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> said he only meant that the
property should be taken over if an equitable
arrangement could be come to. He would drop the
last part of his resolution, and it would now read
as follows:&mdash;'That, considering the want of adequate
space in Small Street for the postal telegram arrangements,
it is desirable that a new Post Office be erected
in Baldwin Street on the site recently viewed by the
Postmaster-General.'</p>

<p>"The motion was then put with the following
result:&mdash;<i>For</i>: Aldermen Lucas, Edwards, Jose,

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Levy</span> asked if the Postmaster-General made

<p>The Council dropped the matter of removal, and
an enlargement of the Post Office was commenced
in 1886 on 5,500 square feet of ground on which
the Rectory House of St. Mary Werburgh formerly
stood. The enlargement was completed in 1889.
The structure was designed by the Surveyor of Her
Majesty's Office of Works. In making his plan in
1868 no doubt the Surveyor thought he was building
for, at least, fifty years; and so he set back his
building to form a square structure, instead of
following the line of street as laid down by the
city authorities in their Act of Parliament. The
new part of the building had to conform to the city
line, and had, therefore, to be built at an angle
with the old office, which detracts from the general
appearance. The Post Office building in Small<!--[156.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Street stands on a site 17,300 square feet in extent;
and now, thirty-one years from the opening of the
new office and ten years from its enlargement,
further extension is necessary, and the erection of a
second or supplementary office larger in dimensions
than the present structure is about to be proceeded
with.</p>

<p>As the work in the Post Office goes on through
the whole day and night, the air in the working
rooms became vitiated and over-heated when lighted
with gas. In 1896 the effectual remedy of abandoning
the use of gas and adopting electric light was
carried out. The Corporation provides the current.
The lamps used are 4 arc lamps, of approximately
750 candle-power each, and 450 glow lamps of 8,
16, or 25 candle-power.</p>

<p>Two million gallons of water a year are used to
keep the buildings clean.</p>

<p>As the Post Office, from its size, if not from its
architectural beauty, dominates Small Street in
some measure it may be well here to introduce
particulars from an ancient manuscript in the City
Library, which show that Small Street has been
a street ever since Anglo-Saxon times. About<!--[159.png]-->

Small Street and St. Leonard's Lane lived some of
Bristol's greatest merchants. For hundreds of years
there was not within the walls of Bristol a more
fashionable street than Small Street. Many of the
mansions there had good gardens. In the reign of
Charles II. there were only six houses on the west,
or Post Office, side of the street. Amongst the
worthies who resided there were the Colstons, the
Creswicks, the Kitchens, the Seymours, the Esterfields,
the Codringtons, the Haymans, the Kilkes;
John Foster, the founder of the almshouse on St.
Michael's Hill; Nicholas Thorne, one of the
founders of our Grammar School; and Thomas
Fenn, attorney, who in 1762 succeeded to the
Earldom of Westmoreland. It is not indicated
whether he was related in any way to William
Fenn, who was postmaster, 1778-88, but it might
have been so, for William Fenn must have been a
person of some note or the appointment would not
at his death have been conferred on his widow. In
Small Street, too, more Royal and noble visitors
have lodged and received hospitality than in any
other street in Bristol. The Earl of Bedford and
his son were received there in 1569, and Robert<!--[160.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Dudley, Earl of Leicester, one of Queen Elizabeth's
favourites, and the Earl of Warwick, in 1587; the
latter lodged at Robert Kitchen's. In 1643 King
Charles I., with Prince Charles and the Duke of
York, lodged there, so did Oliver Cromwell and his
wife in 1649; and James II., with George, Prince
of Denmark, and the Dukes of Grafton, Beaufort,
and Somerset, in 1688. Queen Catherine was entertained
at Sir Henry Creswick's house in 1677,
where Sir Henry, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
the good and great Duke of Ormonde, lodged for
several days in 1665. We learn that Small Street
was selected for the reception of these illustrious
visitors "by reason of the conveniency of the street
for entertaining the nobility."<!--[161.png]-->

<h5>THE LOCAL POST OFFICE IN EARLY DAYS.<br /><br />
SIR ROWLAND HILL.&mdash;RECENT PROGRESS.</h5>


<p>It is pleasing to look back to the time, little
more than one hundred years ago, when Bristol
was the premier provincial post town. It had
long ranked next to London in wealth, in population,
and in its Post Office. Bristol has, however,
in a postal sense, yielded place to other towns, and
now ranks after Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool,
and Manchester.</p>

<p>Dipping into history, it is found that there was
a Post Office at Clifton a hundred years since. At
about the time of the Battle of Waterloo it was
situated near Saville Place, in a small tenement.
The post keeper was a knight of the shears, who
sat cross-legged at his work on a shop-board in the
window, whilst his better-half sold "goodies." The
"Staff" consisted of this pigeon pair, and the
work of carrying the bags to and from Bristol,<!--[162.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and of delivering the missives, was undertaken
by them conjointly.</p>

<p>The year 1793 was signalised by the extension to
Bristol of the penny post for local letters, that is,
letters for Bristol city, its suburbs, and neighbouring
villages. That post covered a wide area ranging
from Thornbury and Wotton-under-Edge in the
North, to Temple Cloud, Chewton-Mendip, and
Oakhill in the South; eastward in the direction of
Box, and westward to Portishead. This institution
had until then been established nowhere else but
in London and in Dublin; but Birmingham, Edinburgh,
and Manchester were granted the privilege
at the same time as Bristol. During the year
1794-95 the penny post brought a clear gain to
the revenue:&mdash;in Bristol of &pound;469, in Manchester
of &pound;586, and in Birmingham of &pound;240. Notwithstanding
these gains, the Post Office authorities
concluded that neither at Liverpool nor at Leeds,
nor at any other town in the Kingdom, would a
penny post defray its own expenses.</p>

<p>There is little more on record about local Post
Office details for some years; but we learn that in
April, 1825, an evening delivery of post letters was<!--[163.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
ordered to Kingsdown, Montpelier, Wellington
Place, and Catherine Place, Stoke's Croft, all the
year round; and to Lawrence Hill, West Street,
Gloucester Lane, in the parish of St. Philip and
Jacob, from 1st of March to 1st of November in
each year. A receiving house for letters was
established at the corner of West Street on May
20th, 1825; and also one in Harford Street, New Cut.
In December, 1827, the population of Bristol was
estimated at 50,000 persons; and in August, 1831,
the number of persons the Post Office had to serve
was 59,070.</p>

<p>Evans's <i>New Guide; or, Pictures of Bristol</i>, published
in 1828, furnishes the next record. It stated
that "the London mail goes out every afternoon at
twenty minutes past 5, and arrives every day at 9.0
in the morning. Bath: Out every morning at 7.0 and
10.0, and at twenty minutes past 5 in the evening;
arrives at 9.0 morning, and a quarter before 5 and
a quarter before 7 in the evening. Sodbury,
through Stapleton, Hambrook, Winterbourne, and
Iron Acton: Goes out at twenty minutes before 10
in the morning; arrives at half-past 4 in the
evening. Thornbury, through Filton, Almondsbury,<!--[164.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and Rudgeway: Goes out twenty minutes before
10 in the morning; arrives at half-past 4 in the
evening. Bitton, through New Church, Kingswood,
Hanham, and Willsbridge: Goes out at 10.0 in the
morning; arrives at half-past 4 in the evening.
Exeter and Westward: Out every morning between
9.0 and 10.0; arrives every evening between 4.0
and 5.0. Portsmouth, Chichester, Salisbury, etc.:
Out at half-past 5 in the afternoon; arrives every
day previously to the London mail. Tetbury and
Cirencester: Out every morning at half-past 9;
arrives every evening at 5.0. Birmingham and
Northward: Out every evening at 7.0; arrives every
morning between 6.0 and 7.0. Milford and South
Wales: Out every day at half-past 9; arrives at
half-past 3 in the afternoon. The Irish mail is
made up every day, and letters from Ireland may
be expected to arrive every day at half-past 3.
Jamaica and Leeward Islands, first and third
Wednesday in the month; Lisbon, every week;
Gibraltar and Mediterranean, every three weeks;
Madeira and Brazils, first Tuesday in each month;
Surinam, Berbice, and Demorara, second Wednesday
in each month; France and Spain, Sundays, Mondays,<!--[165.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Wednesdays, and Thursdays; Holland and Hamburgh,
Mondays and Thursdays; Guernsey and
Jersey, Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Letters
for all parts may be put into the Post Office at
any time, but should be delivered half an hour
before the mail is made up. Letters delivered later
than half an hour previous to the departure of
the respective mails to be accompanied with one
penny. Payment of postage will not be received
unless tendered full half an hour before the time
fixed for closing the bags. Letters for Axbridge,
Weston-super-Mare, and adjacent places are sent
and received by the Western mail. Letter bags
are made up daily, after the sorting of the London
mail, for Bourton, Wrington, Langford, Churchill,
Nailsea, Clevedon, and their respective deliveries.
The letters must be put in by 9.0 o'clock. The
return to Bristol is at 4.0 in the afternoon. Letters
may be put into the receiving offices for all parts
of the kingdom, and the full postage, if desired,
paid with them. Letter carriers are despatched
regularly every day (Sundays not excepted) with
letters to and from Durdham Down, Westbury,
Stapleton, Frenchay, Downend, Hambrook, and<!--[166.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Winterbourne; and also to Brislington, Keynsham,
and other places. The delivery of letters at Clifton
is each day at 10.0 and 6.0. Letters should be in
the offices at Clifton and the Wells for the London
and the North mails by 4.0."</p>

<p>It may be interesting to state, what the rates of
postage from this city were in 1830. Thus: Australia,
11d.; Buenos Ayres, 3s. 5d.; Canary Islands, 2s. 6d.;
Cape de Verde Islands, 2s. 6d.; Chili, 3s. 5d.;
China, 11d.; Colombo, 3s.; Cuba, 3s.; East Indies,
11d.; Havana, 3s.; St. Helena, 11d.; South
America, 3s. 5d.; Van Dieman's Land, 11d.; whilst
for the Continent the rates were considerably higher,
thus: Austria, 2s. 2d.; Belgium, 1s. 11d.; Corsica,
2s. 2d.; Denmark, 2s. 3d.; Flanders, 2s. 2d.;
France&mdash;Calais, 1s. 5d.; Germany, 2s. 3d.; Gibraltar,
2s. 6d.; Holland, 1s. 11d.; Italy, 2s. 2d.; Malta,
2s. 6d.; Poland, 2s. 3d.; Prussia, 2s. 3d.; Russia,
2s. 3d.; Spain, 2s. 2d.; Turkey, 2s. 2d. At that
period the Inland Rates were very high, and
the cost was regulated thus: From any Post
Office in England or Wales, to any place not
exceeding 15 miles from such office, 4d.; above 15
to 20 miles, 5d.; 20 to 30 miles, 6d.; 30 to 50 miles,<!--[167.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
7d.; 50 to 80 miles, 8d.; 80 to 120 miles, 9d.; 120
to 170 miles, 10d.; 170 to 230 miles, 11d.; 230 to
300 miles, 12d. And one penny in addition on each
letter for every 100 miles beyond 300. Thus a
letter from Bristol to Cirencester cost 7d.; Cheltenham,
8d.; Banbury, 10d.; Leeds, 11d.; Hull; 12d.,
and so on. Now a letter four ounces in weight
can be sent from one end of the land to the other
for a penny, and a parcel one pound in weight for
threepence.</p>

<p>The Bristol ex-Postal Superintendent, Mr. H. T.
Carter, carrying his mind back over his forty years
of diligent and zealous service, recalls the time
when the mails for the not far-distant village of
Shirehampton were conveyed in a cart drawn by a
dog, the property of rural postman Ham. The cart
was not large, but of sufficient size to carry postman
and mail bags. The dog, of Newfoundland breed,
got over the ground at a rapid pace. Ham was
addicted to drink, but nevertheless, whether he was
drunk or sober, asleep or awake, in stormy or fine
weather, the dog took him and the mails to their
proper destination.</p>

<p>A venerable man now living at Earthcott Green,<!--[168.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
a hamlet within ten miles of our great city, well
recollects the time when he received his letters
through Iron Acton, at a special cost to him of 2d.
each, with a delivery only every other day. The
plan was for an additional penny to be charged on
all letters sent out by rural posts for delivery, and
in addition to this penny an extra charge was levied
on all letters delivered from sub-Post Offices to bye
houses or places beyond the several village deliveries.
In some cases recognised men or women attended at
the Head Office, Bristol, once or twice a week to
take out letters for delivery in the remote country
regions&mdash;of course for a "consideration."</p>

<p>The Bristol district shared in the representations
in 1838 of the hardships borne by poor people in
respect of the heavy charges for the conveyance of
letters. The postmaster at Congresbury deposed
thus:&mdash;"The price of a letter is a great tax on poor
people. I sent one, charged eightpence, to a poor
labouring man about a week ago; it came from his
daughter. He first refused it, saying it would take
a loaf of bread from his other children; but, after
hesitating a little time, he paid the money, and
opened the letter. I seldom return letters of this<!--[169.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
kind to Bristol, because I let the poor people have
them, and take the chance of being paid; sometimes
I lose the postage, but generally the poor people
pay me by degrees." Then the postmaster of
Yatton stated as follows:&mdash;"I have had a letter
waiting lately for a poor woman, from her husband
who is at work in Wales; the charge was 9d.,&mdash;it lay
many days, in consequence of her not being able to
pay the postage. I at last trusted her with it." Of
the desire of the poor to correspond, a Mr. Emery
gave evidence, stating "that the poor near Bristol
have signed a petition to Parliament for the
reduction of the postage. He never saw greater
enthusiasm in any public thing that was ever got up
in the shape of a petition; they seemed all to enter
into the thing as fully and with as much feeling as
it was possible, as a boon or godsend to them, that
they should be able to correspond with their distant
friends."</p>

<p>Uniform penny postage came in 1840. The
Bristol citizens, of course, found it no cheaper than
before to send a single letter to places in their own
neighbourhood, but a light enclosure could be put
in without extra charge, though the weight had<!--[170.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to be brought down from four ounces to half an
ounce.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to mention in these
pages that one of the penny postage stamps of the
very earliest issue after the penny postage system
came into operation in 1840 was made use of for
the prepayment of a letter sent by His Grace the
Duke of Wellington to H. Nuttall Tomlins, Esq.,
of the Hotwells, Bristol. It was sent six days
before stamps and stamped covers were first
used by the general public, the Duke, as Prime
Minister, having no doubt been supplied in
advance with stamps, one of which he attached
to his letter, to give a surprise to his friend
Nuttall Tomlins. The envelope, with the stamp
still upon it, is now in the possession of a well-known
philatelist in London.</p>

<p>The allusion to the "Penny Post" naturally calls
to mind its originator. On the hill slope of the
still pleasant rural village of Stapleton, four
miles from Bristol Post Office,&mdash;once a Roman
settlement, and in later days the head-quarters of
Oliver Cromwell during the siege of Bristol,&mdash;the
great postal reformer, Sir Rowland Hill, frequently<!--[171.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
spent some of his leisure time with his brother,
the late Recorder of Bristol, Mr. Matthew Davenport
Hill. There is in the Bristol postal service at
the present time a mail officer who recalls that, in
his very young days, it was his mission to set out
from Heath House to fetch the morning letters for
Sir Rowland from the Stapleton Post Office. He
tells how he had to ride the old pony at a rapid
rate, as, even in those days, Sir Rowland's time was
valuable, and if his letters were late he had to
curtail his "constitutional," which usually consisted
of a three-mile sharp walk, with cap in hand instead
of on head, over Purdown, past Stoke House,
returning through Frenchay.</p>

<p>In December, 1844, Sir Rowland Hill, in connection
with the National Testimonial to him as the
author of Penny Postage, recorded the circumstance
that he had received a letter from Mr. Estlin, an
eminent surgeon of Bristol, giving an account of
proceedings in that important city anterior to any
movement in London. Sir Rowland believed it was
in Bristol, and from Mr. Estlin, that the testimonial
had its origin. The sum presented from Bristol to
the national collection amounted to about &pound;300.<!--[172.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>


<p>The celebration of the Jubilee of Penny Postage
in 1890 took the practical turn in one respect of
increasing the Rowland Hill Benevolent Fund.
Bristol contributed its quota of &pound;72 14s. 6d., made
up in great measure of public subscriptions. When
the grand celebration took place on July 2nd, at
the South Kensington Museum, with the Duke and
Duchess of Edinburgh present at the conversazione,
Bristol took its part, and immediately after a signal
from South Kensington was received over the telegraph
wire at 10 o'clock three hearty cheers for
Her Majesty were given, the postmaster leading.
The Post Office band then struck up the National
Anthem, and cheers for the Queen were at once
taken up by a body of about 200 postmen who had
assembled in the Post Office yard.</p>

<p>As in 1847 the state of things at the provincial
offices generally was not regarded as satisfactory,
Sir Rowland Hill, in accordance with the wish of
the Postmaster-General, visited Bristol on April
1st in that year. He found that the first delivery
of the day, by far the most important of all, was
not completed until 12 o'clock; the letter-carriers,
as he was informed, often staying after departure<!--[173.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
from the office to take their breakfast before commencing
their rounds. He was able to show how
at a small cost (only &pound;125 a year) it might be
completed by 9.0. The office itself he found small,
badly lighted, and ill ventilated. The day mail
bag to London was nearly useless, its contents
for London delivery being on the morning of his
inquiry only sixty-four letters, thirty-seven of which
might have been sent by the previous mail on the
mere payment of the extra penny. His impression
regarding this mail, both in and out of the office,
agreed exactly with his evidence in 1843; viz., that
all day mails, to be efficient for their purpose, should
start as late as was consistent with their reaching
London in time for their letters to be forwarded by
the outgoing evening mails. The satisfaction Sir
Rowland felt in such improvements as he had been
able to make on the spot was much enhanced by
his receiving at the termination of his visit the
thanks of both clerks and letter-carriers for the new
arrangements. It should be said that Sir Rowland
Hill did not by his action cast any reflection upon
Mr. Todd Walton, junior, as he was at pains to say
that, regarded as a specimen of the administration<!--[174.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of provincial Post Offices at the time the Bristol
specimen was by no means an unfavourable one.
At that time there were only about 20,000 letters,
etc., delivered in a week.</p>

<p>The Bristol Chamber of Commerce took no
notice of the Post Office for nearly twenty years
(1835-1855), but in the latter year it did so, for
its records of the annual meeting of 31st January,
1855, with John Salmon, President, in the chair,
shew the following, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Post Office questions of salaries, internal
arrangements, and local inquiry, are still in the same
position as they were six months ago, except that,
after repeated further applications to the Postmaster-General,
your Committee extracted, on the 10th
December last, a renewed promise from his lordship
that 'no time should be lost in making the enquiry
at the Bristol Post Office.' As the inefficiency of
the public service arises from the unjust treatment
of the employ&eacute;s and defective internal arrangements
of the local office, your Committee cannot desist, notwithstanding
the tedious and disagreeable nature of
the task which they have undertaken, from insisting
on these repeated promises being redeemed."<!--[175.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>


<p>Then, under the same presidency, at the next
half-yearly meeting in the same year, it was stated
that "Subsequent to the date of the last report,
your Committee discovered that the Postmaster-General
had caused a private local enquiry to be
made with respect to the classification and salaries
of the officers of the Bristol Post Office."</p>

<p>There was this further remonstrance:&mdash;</p>

<p>".... It would have been more satisfactory
to your Committee if the Postmaster-General had
fulfilled his promise to the deputation who waited
upon him on the 30th of January, 1854, to hold
a local enquiry at which they should be present, as
there were several other matters connected with the
internal arrangements of the Bristol Post Office
(particularly the money order department, which is
still very defective) with respect to which they were
desirous of making some suggestions."</p>

<p>Then followed a copy of the report made to the
Postmaster-General by Mr. Tilley, who conducted
the enquiry, also a statement of the proposed
Establishment.</p>

<p>At the Chamber's next annual meeting on 30th
January, 1856, with James Hassell, the president,<!--[176.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
in the chair, the Post Office is again reproved
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No further reply than the official printed
acknowledgment and promise of attention has yet
reached your Committee respecting the memorial
on the subject of the Welsh mail, the West India
mails, etc.; but past experience and general repute
do not lead them to anticipate prompt redress from
the Post Office authorities. It required repeated
applications, extending over a period of about
eighteen months, to obtain a remedy for the
grievances set forth in our former memorial; and
even now the Money Order Department is not
completed, and probably similar perseverance will
again be required, as it is now more than a month
ago the memorial relating to the West India mail
was presented."</p>

<p>It was thought worthy of note in the <i>Bristol
Mirror</i> of November 5th, 1831, that "500 letters
were brought yesterday from Clifton for the general
post." In demonstration of the strides which the
Post Office has made, it may be mentioned that in
the "fifties," in addition to the Post Office at
Clifton, the only offices were the branches at<!--[177.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Haberfield Crescent and Phippen Street, with four
collections a day, and the receiving houses at
Ashley Road, Bedminster, Hotwells, and Redland,
with three collections a day. The city only boasted
at that time of pillar letter boxes at Arley Chapel,
Armoury Square, Bedminster Bridge, Bristol Bridge,
Castle Street, Christmas Steps, College Green, Freemantle
Square, Kingsdown, Milk Street, Railway
Station, St. Philip's Police Station, Kingsland Road,
Whiteladies Road, and Woodwell Crescent, with
three collections daily. Now there are 167 Post
Offices in the district. On the Gloucestershire side
there are 99, at 41 of which telegraph business is
carried on; and on the Somersetshire side 68, 27
of which are telegraph offices. In addition telegraph
business is carried on for the Postmaster-General
at five railway stations on the Gloucestershire
side and five on the Somersetshire side.
Licenses to sell postage stamps are held by over
a hundred shopkeepers.</p>

<p>There are now 350 pillar and wall letter boxes
provided for public convenience.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned in passing that during the
strike amongst the deal-runners in Bristol, when<!--[178.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
men were brought from other towns and housed
and fed at "Huntersholm" (a large wooden
building erected specially in one of the timber
yards), and allowed out under police supervision,
a stamp license was applied for and granted, to
meet a large demand for postage stamps which
these men made in consequence of having to send
their wages home weekly to their families.</p>

<p>In detail, but without complication by mention of
the names of all the districts, the local improvements
for the seven years from March, 1892, to February,
1899, inclusive, were as follows:&mdash;New post offices
established, 33; telegraph offices opened, 18; money
order and savings bank business extended to 17
offices; postal orders sold at 6 additional offices;
new pillar and wall boxes erected, 142; new or
additional day mails from 34 districts; and out
to 44 districts; new extra deliveries established in
65 districts, and two extra deliveries in 7 districts.
Free delivery extended in 35 rural districts, and
the ordinary second or third delivery extended in
44 rural districts; morning delivery accelerated in
63, and the day delivery in 8, rural districts. A
later posting for North mail in 6, and for the<!--[179.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
night mail in 58, rural districts. New collections
established in 73, and a later collection in 30, rural
districts.</p>

<p>Increased facilities in the postal world are almost
invariably followed by augmentation of business.
It certainly has been so in the Bristol district, for
there has been a marvellous development in the
last seven years. The letters delivered have
increased by 60 per cent., and those posted have
grown at the rate of 55 per cent. Parcels have
increased by 25 per cent. There has been
a similar marked increase in all branches of
business. The three preceding periods of seven
years were comparatively "lean" periods, for the
increase in the number of letters during the whole
twenty-one years was actually less than during the
seven last years. The increase is altogether out of
proportion to the growth of population, and it
is far in excess of the general increase of letter
correspondence throughout the country generally,
which has been only at the rate of 22 per cent.
during the period as against Bristol's 60 per
cent. It is hoped that this may be taken as a sure
indication of the well-being of the trade of Bristol,<!--[180.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and as a sign that there is quickened life in the
commerce of the good old city. At all events, it
shows that the local Post Office organization is quite
abreast of the times, and that the facilities afforded
are appreciated and are fully taken advantage of.<!--[181.png]-->

<h5>BRISTOL AS A MAIL STEAMER STATION FOR IRELAND,
WEST INDIES, AMERICA, AND CANADA.</h5>


<p>From the archives of the Bristol Chamber of
Commerce it transpires that from the very first
constitution of the Chamber in 1823, it had before
it a scheme for the conveyance of mails between
this port and the South of Ireland by direct steam
packet. It was considered that such a service would
be highly advantageous to the city, and correspondence
on the subject from time to time took
place with the Post Office Department. Allusion
is made to it in the Chamber's Annual Report in
January, 1824; again in 1828, when the President
of the Chamber, Mr. Joseph Cookson, had a conference
with the leading officer of the Post Office;
and once more in 1829. The case is so fully and
ably set forth in the Board's Annual Report of the
26th January, 1829, that its reproduction <i>in extenso</i>
cannot fail to be of deep interest to the citizens of<!--[182.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the present day as their attention is often drawn to
the steamship traffic. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The transmission of the mails direct from Bristol
was earnestly pressed upon the attention of the
Postmaster-General in the year 1823, on which
occasion the Chamber minutely investigated the
practicability, safety, and general advantages of the
measure, the material points of which were embodied
in a memorial, accompanied by a list of queries and
replies. The Civic Corporation, the Society of
Merchant Venturers, and the Bristol Dock Company
each presented similar memorials.</p>

<p>"In resuming the enquiry, the Board have resorted
to the channels best calculated to convey accurate
information. The managing proprietor of the
steam packet establishments at this port, Captain
Dungey, an individual on whose experience and
judgment reliance may be placed, and other persons
of practical knowledge, have been consulted on the
subject. All concur in establishing the fact that
the voyage to and from Dunmore may, with general
certainty, be accomplished by efficient steamboats
in from 24 to 26 hours during the eight summer
months, and in from 26 to 30 hours in the four<!--[183.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
months of winter; that the instances of exceeding
this scale would not be more frequent than at the
present station, the navigation of the Bristol
Channel being protected by the coast on either side,
and consequently less influenced by severe weather
than the Irish Sea.</p>

<p>"The earlier arrival of the London mail and its
later departure, as altered some time since, accords
materially with the proposition for making Bristol
a packet station. By the present regulations, the
London mail arrives in Bristol at five minutes past
9 in the morning; and leaves at half-past 5 in
the evening; it is capable of being still further
accelerated by taking the two last stages in the
direct line through Marshfield, instead of passing
through Bath. According to the present arrangements,
the Irish mails may with ease and convenience
to passengers be despatched from the mouth of the
Bristol river, five miles from the Post Office, every
day at half-past 10, and those from Ireland, if
arriving by 4.0, be forwarded to London the same
evening. The time saved by this route as compared
with that of Milford would be, at least during the
summer months, equal to one whole day for the<!--[184.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
purposes of business, since the arrival at Dunmore
would be in the morning instead of evening, and
the departure at noon instead of at an early hour
of the morning as at present.</p>

<p>"The present slips at Lamplighter's Hall and
Broad Pill now serve for landing passengers from
the packets on special occasions; with very trifling
expense they may be made efficient for passengers,
and not more objectionable than the present accommodation
for crossing the estuary of the Severn&mdash;carriages,
horses, baggage, and heavy goods might
at an earlier hour be put on board at the Bristol
Docks, which the boat would leave at the height
of tide in order to be in waiting for the mails
at the place appointed for receiving them. At
Lamplighter's Hall an hotel is established, which,
with the contiguity to the city, would ensure to the
public a supply of all the accommodation a packet
station would require. These are the facilities
which can at present be afforded. At no very
distant date the accommodation will, in all
probability, be yet further increased, first, by the
erection of a pier with hotel and establishment at
Portishead on the Somersetshire side of the Avon,<!--[185.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
which the Corporation of the City have for some
time had under consideration with a view to
promote the convenience of passengers by the
steam vessels and thus encourage the intercourse
between this city and the South of Ireland. In aid
of the present enquiry they have directed a survey
and report by Mr. Milne, the engineer, on the
practicability and probable cost of the proposed
pier. Secondly, and arising also from this scheme,
is a plan for erecting a bridge across the Avon, by
the application in part of a fund amounting to
nearly &pound;8,000, held by the Society of Merchant
Venturers in trust under the will of William Vick,
deceased, for the especial purpose; with the formation
of an improved line of road by Mr. Gordon, Mr.
Miles, and other landed proprietors on that side of
the river, for the short distance to Portishead.
These several improvements the respective parties
interested are disposed to effect, and which any
impelling motive, such as the establishment of
a regular mail packet station, may induce them
immediately to undertake. The accomplishment of
these works would render Portishead a most eligible
station. It is protected from weather, is a safe<!--[186.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
anchorage, would have ample depth of water at
any state of the tide, the landing would be instant
on arrival, and it would be supplied with every
convenience and accommodation for passengers.</p>

<p>"The Board believe an important saving of
expense to Government would result from establishing
Bristol as a mail packet station. The great
deficiency on the Milford station in the receipts as
compared with the expenditure arises from the very
limited number of persons who avail themselves of
that line of communication. The land journey of
twenty hours at a fare of &pound;3 10s., followed by a
twelve hours' voyage by open sea at a further
expense of &pound;1 10s., with the inconvenience frequently
sustained in crossing the estuary of the Severn,
deters people from taking the Milford route by
choice. The general introduction of steam packets,
the degree of perfection in sailing to which they
have been brought, the regularity and safety with
which the voyages are performed, the accommodation
to passengers, and the moderate scale of fares,
have contributed to effect of late years a material
change in the general opinion on steamboat conveyance.
The long voyage by sea is now generally<!--[187.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
preferred to a long journey by land and the shorter
one by sea. The number and efficiency of the
Bristol boats, and the economy in the fares, induce a
large proportion of travellers to take the direct
course from Bristol. Indeed, to so great an extent
has this preference operated that the contractors for
conveying the mail throughout the whole line from
Bristol to Milford are understood to have given
notice of their intention to determine their engagement,
on account of the gradual decrease in the
number of passengers and the consequent loss they
incur. A similar statement appears in the report of
the Postmaster-General on the memorial of the
innkeepers on the Holyhead route.</p>

<p>"In favour of Bristol it may be fairly stated that,
at a comparatively trifling expense, the port may be
made commodious for a packet station; that the
present strength of the establishment at Milford
would serve, with some addition, for that of Bristol;
that the difference in price of coal at Portishead
would reduce the expense of sailing the packets from
that station; that Bristol affords every prospect of
increase of receipt, whilst at Milford it must, for the
reasons before stated, necessarily decrease; that the<!--[188.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
demands of a large commercial city, with its populous
adjoining and connected districts, will create a traffic
for boats making quick and regular voyages, which
Milford, from its position, never can acquire&mdash;the
conveyance of fish and provisions alone could be
made to yield a revenue of consequence. Numerous
other sources of receipt would arise from the conveniency
of its regularity and expedition. Indeed,
so much are the Board impressed with the belief
that the traffic would be extensive and productive
that they venture to anticipate it may, at no very
distant period, relieve the Government from any
further charge than a comparatively nominal sum
for the transport of the mails. The Board are
induced also to put the proposition in a national
point of view. They feel that the more closely
Ireland can be brought into direct and active communication
with this country, the more rapid will be
its course of improvement. The introduction of
steam navigation has, at this port, given an energy
and extension to the Irish trade that far exceeds any
previous expectations; each succeeding month brings
a vast increase of import and a corresponding export,
to the material benefit of each kingdom, and the<!--[189.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
more complete the intercourse can be established the
more important will the trade become.</p>

<p>"The port of Bristol, from its position, possesses
numerous capabilities for a mail packet station. Its
contiguity and means of land and water communication
with the capital; its being the principal
shipping port for the manufacturing districts of
the South-west part of the kingdom; its close connection
and water communication with Birmingham,
Worcester, and other large towns in the centre of
the kingdom; the convenience of its floating
harbour; the reduced scale of its local tolls&mdash;all
these circumstances combine to give Bristol a
superiority over other places on the coast, whether
the subject he viewed as regards the economy of
the Post Office Department or the accommodation
of the public.</p>

<p>"The Board have placed the subject of the
Commissioners' enquiry in the several points of
view which appear to them fairly to arise upon
the investigation and consideration it has received,
and they shall feel sincere gratification if, on this
or any future occasion, they should in the least
degree prove of assistance to a department of<!--[190.png]-->

Government, or should otherwise by their exertions
conduce to the advancement of the public
interests.</p>

<br /></p>


<p>A strong memorial (under the hand of Thomas
Cookson, President) was forwarded to the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>Francis Freeling, Secretary, in his reply for the
Postmaster-General, refused to admit that the port
of Bristol did afford the requisite facilities for a
station for His Majesty's packets. When the projected
works were carried out the matter would be
reconsidered by the Government.</p>

<p>Replying further, Mr. Freeling, on the 2nd
March, alluded to the impossibility of despatching
the mails at a fixed time every day in the year,
and said that that presented insurmountable objections
to the choice of Bristol as a station for His
Majesty's packets. He said that the first requisite
for a packet station was that the port should afford
the means for embarking and landing the mails
at all times of tide and under all circumstances of
weather.<!--[191.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>


<p>The Bristol Dock Directors and a Standing
Committee of the Society of Merchants considered
the matter, but did not see their way to press it
under the chilling response received from the
Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>The Board did not give up the case, for in
the Annual Report 28th January, 1833, it was
stated that the proposition for establishing at this
port a mail packet station by steam vessels to the
South of Ireland was being diligently pursued, and
that the House of Commons having appointed a
Committee to enquire into the communications
between England and Ireland, a favourable
opportunity was presented of again urging the
advantages Bristol port was calculated to afford.</p>

<p>The numerous appeals, representations, and
enquiries did not result in the manner desired,
and to this day the mails from the South of
Ireland for Bristol and its district follow the
same route <i>vi&acirc;</i> Waterford and Milford Haven, the
only difference being that from the latter port to
Bristol the service is carried on by rail instead
of by road.</p>

<p>Bristol became a mail packet station eventually,<!--[192.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
as steamships carried the American mails between
this port and New York for several years, commencing
in 1837, the year of Her Most Gracious
Majesty's accession to the throne. The <i>Great
Western</i>, constructed under the direction of Brunel,
the famous engineer of the Great Western Railway,
was chiefly used in the service.</p>

<p>On the 31st May, 1838, writing from 19 Trinity
Street, Bristol, Mr. Claxton, managing director to
the <i>Great Western</i>&mdash;which was then, nearly due,&mdash;asked
the Bristol postmaster whether a consignee
at New York might charge the foreign postage on
letters to parts on the Continent with which no
arrangement, similar to that then existing between
France and England, had been made. The idea
was that such letters might be put into a separate
bag, and the foreign postage from Bristol be handed
over to the local Post Office. He wrote that notice
had been given by the Chamber of Commerce of
Liverpool that masters of ships need not send
anything but letters to the Post Office on arrival.
Mr. Todd Walton replied on the next day to the
effect that the agent should only direct letters to
Mr. Claxton's care to forward from such persons<!--[195.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
<!--[194.png]-->
as he could refer to in case of errors. Then followed
a long communication from Mr. Walton to Colonel
Maberly, Secretary to the Post Office, the gist of
which was that a difficulty existed in preventing
illegal conveyance of ship letters; that the commanders
of vessels did not receive money with
letters to any great extent; that the public prints
stated that 1,600 letters were received on board
the <i>Great Western</i> besides those sent from the
Post Office; that an immense number of letters
was collected at the Great Western office; and that
as the <i>Great Western</i> and <i>Syrius</i> were regularly
established, and other vessels of the same description
were preparing, unless some means were taken
to protect the revenue, it could not fail to suffer
very considerably.</p>

<p>The <i>Great Western</i> brought to England 5,500 post
letters and 1,770 post papers, which, had that conveyance
not been offered, would most likely have been sent
by private ships. Mr. Walton conceived it would be
very advantageous to the revenue to contract with
those superior vessels to carry mails, so as to render
the latter chargeable with package rates; and he
submitted that ship letter mails should be made up<!--[196.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
at Bristol, the same as at London and Liverpool,
for all vessels leaving this port. About 5,500 ship
letters were brought to the Bristol Post Office
annually, and he had no doubt that vast numbers
were carried from Bristol in the same manner; but
with the exception of those by the <i>Great Western</i>,
no mails had ever been made up here for foreign
countries. The Secretary, replying for the Postmaster-General,
said it did not appear to Lord
Lichfield that cognizance need be taken of the
suggestion conveyed in Mr. Claxton's letter of the
31st May, for the transmission through this country
of letters from the United States addressed to those
foreign countries upon which the postage must be
paid here before they can be forwarded to their
destination. The Post Office could have no objection
to such letters being addressed to the care of
Mr. Claxton or any other agent in this country who
would pay the foreign postage and send them on
to their destinations. The letters in question, would,
of course, be subject, so far as the Post Office was
concerned, to the ship letter rate to Bristol, and
when re-posted, to the inland and foreign rates
forward.<!--[197.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>


<p>The postmaster's proposition for making up mails
to be forwarded by the steam vessels charged with
packet rates of postage was out of the question;
but with regard to making up ship letter bags for
foreign countries, so strangely neglected at this
great port, the postmaster was to embrace every
opportunity in his power of despatching ship letter
bags by sailing as well as by steam vessels. There
is no official record, however, of any such ship letter
mails having been forwarded from Bristol.</p>

<p>In the year 1841 a Royal Commission was
appointed to enquire into the question of the
most suitable port for the embarkation and debarkation
of the West Indian Mails. The committee
consisted of Mr. Freshfield, Lord Dalmeny, Lord
Viscount Ingestre, Captain Pechell, Captain Duncombe,
Mr. Chas. Wood, Sir Thomas Cochrane,
Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Cresswell, Lord Worsley,
Mr. Gibson Craig, Mr. De Horsey, Mr. Oswold,
Mr. Richard Hodgson, and Mr. Philip Miles, who
was prominent as representing Bristol. Much
evidence was given in favour of the ports of Bristol,
Dartmouth, Devonport, Falmouth, Plymouth, Portsmouth,
and Southampton respectively. The case<!--[198.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of Bristol was strongly supported by Lieut. J.
Hosken, R.N., commander of the <i>Great Western</i>
screw steamer from Bristol to New York, and
Lieut. C. Claxton, R.N., the Bristol Harbour Master.</p>

<p>The principal reasons put forward in favour of
our old port were: that the Bristol Channel was
navigable at all states of the tide and in all weathers;
that there was good anchorage in the Kingroad; and
that although Bristol was not quite so near to
Barbadoes, the first island of call, as some of her
rival ports, yet it admitted of quicker transmission of
mails between London and the northern towns than
any other English port. The arguments in favour
of the Bristol port were not strong enough to induce
the committee to report in its favour.</p>

<p>From the "forties," when the American mail
service was withdrawn from Bristol, no foreign or
colonial mails left the port until the autumn of
1898, when Mr. Alfred Jones, the enterprising
managing director of the firm of Messrs. Elder,
Dempster &amp; Co., made arrangements for carrying
private ship mails from Avonmouth to Montreal
by a weekly service of steamers. The Bristol
merchants found it convenient to make use of this<!--[199.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
ship mail system for the conveyance of their invoices,
bills of lading, and advices, as, by travelling
in the same ship as the goods which they related
to, their delivery in time to be of use in connection
with the ship's load was ensured. The first vessel
to carry such a ship mail was the s.s. <i>Montcalm</i>.</p>

<p>When it was in anticipation at the Bristol Post
Office that the ship mail service might be resumed
in 1899 on the breaking up of the ice in the Gulf
of St. Lawrence, there came a cablegram from the
Canadian Government intimating that a contract
had been entered into with Messrs. Elder, Dempster
and Co.; and, heigh presto! Avonmouth at once
became the port of departure and arrival of the
steamers carrying the direct Canadian mails. The
suddenness of the event naturally created quite a
stir after Bristol had been so long waiting, and the
mail services outwards and inwards were watched
with close attention by the public. The first
steamer to run under the new contract was the
s.s. <i>Monterey</i>. She left Avonmouth on the 23rd
July, but time had not admitted of arrangements
being made for her to carry the mails from
Avonmouth, which were therefore picked up at<!--[200.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Queenstown. The s.s. <i>Ikbal</i> took the next trip,
leaving Avonmouth on the 30th July. The parcels
from the whole of the kingdom, including Ireland,
were circulated on Bristol, and made up here in
direct mails for Montreal, Quebec, Hamilton,
Kingston, Toronto, Winnipeg, Prince Edward
Island, Hawaii, St. Pierre and Miquelon, Nova
Scotia, British Columbia, Kobe, Nagasaki, and
Yokohama. The notice to the Bristol Post Office
was very short, but the necessary arrangements
were smartly made to meet the emergency. Mr.
Kislingbury, the divisional superintendent of the
Great Western Railway, ever ready to heartily
co-operate with the local Post Office, had a
special tender placed in readiness for the
reception of the mails at Temple Meads
and they were despatched by the 9.50 a.m.
train to Avonmouth. On the part of the Dock
authorities, the general manager, Mr. F. B. Girdlestone,
had provided an engine to take the brake-vans
containing the parcel mails direct from the
Docks junction to the pier head. The system was
fully tried, for the mails had to be taken from the
train to the steam-tug <i>Sea Prince</i> to be conveyed to<!--[203.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
<!--[202.png]-->
the steamer, which was moored in Kingroad, having
arrived too late to enter the dock. The mails
weighed close upon three tons, and were contained
in fifty-five large hampers. In the following week
the s.s. <i>Arawa</i> (a sixteen-knot boat, 440 feet long)
carried the mails, which were taken by train alongside
the ship in dock; and which consequently,
although five tons in weight, were put on board
under much more favourable circumstances than in
the preceding week, when the steamer had to lie out
in the Kingroad. It is noteworthy that the <i>Arawa</i>
took out 400 emigrants.</p>

</div>

<p>Subsequent steamers used for carrying on the mail
service were the <i>Montfort</i>, <i>Monteagle</i>, and <i>Montrose</i>.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the new service worked
very smoothly from the outset, thanks in no small
measure to Mr. Flinn, the local general manager
for Messrs. Elder, Dempster &amp; Co., who facilitated
in every way the Post Office and Customs operations.
The trial so far has proved that the use of Avonmouth
as a port for the Canadian mail traffic is
attended with advantages on this side of the ocean,
but greater facilities for embarking and disembarking
the mails at Avonmouth are absolutely necessary.<!--[204.png]-->

<h5>POSTAL SERVICE STAFF; ITS COMPOSITION, DUTIES,
RESPONSIBILITIES.&mdash;VOLUME OF WORK.</h5>


<p>In 1855 the Bristol Post Office staff consisted
of a postmaster and fifteen clerks, with sixty-four
letter carriers. Over 1,500 people of all
grades, including sub-postmasters and their assistants,
are now employed; and the annual bill for
salaries, wages, and allowances of men, women,
and boys amounts to little short of &pound;100,000. It
will thus be seen that the Post Office ranks as
one of the largest employers of labour in the
western city.</p>

<p>The head office is centrally situated both for
the receipt and despatch of the letter correspondence.
It is not very far from a point known as
"Tramway Centre," upon which the tram services
of the city converge. It plays an important part
with regard to the Bristol postal system, as out of
a total of 833,000 letters posted weekly in the city<!--[205.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
delivery area&mdash;exclusive of 55,300 Clifton posted
letters&mdash;221,000 letters are posted at the head
office itself, and the total posted within a radius
of a mile is 652,290, or more than three-fourths of
the whole. In addition to the 888,000 letters posted
weekly in Bristol city and Clifton, there are 108,000
letters posted in the suburban and rural districts.
The posting every Sunday consists of 35,000 letters.</p>

<p>The greater extent to which the well-to-do classes
in Bristol use the post than their less fortunate
brethren may be gathered from the fact that the
average yield of letters, newspapers, etc., per day
per box in the Clifton district is 128 per cent. higher
than in Redland and Cotham, and 179 per cent.
higher than in Redcliffe; and in the Redland
and Cotham district 22 per cent. higher than in
Redcliffe.</p>

<p>The mails are chiefly conveyed between the head
office and the principal railway station by horsed
carts.</p>

<p>About 7,000,000 "forward" letters&mdash;that is,
letters neither posted nor delivered locally, but
passing through the Bristol Post Office&mdash;are dealt
with annually.<!--[206.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>


<p>The parcel post, started in 1883, has done well
in Bristol. Nearly three-quarters of a million of
parcels are posted in the district annually. The
greater part of the parcel despatching duties is
performed at a separate parcel office on the Temple
Meads Railway Station premises. People often
avail themselves of the parcel post for obtaining
a regular weekly supply of produce. A joint of
beef from Scotland, weighing just under eleven
pounds, invariably reaches Bristol at the week end,
and a package of butter from Dublin is observed
every Friday in the Bristol parcel dep&ocirc;t on its way
to Weston-super-Mare.</p>

<p>The London mail is, naturally, the most important
mail which leaves Bristol. In the course of the day
fifty-five mail bags are forwarded, containing about
20,000 letters; the trains used being those leaving
at 3.10 a.m., 7.50 a.m., 9.35 a.m., 11.40 a.m., 12.13
p.m., 1.54 p.m., 3.0 p.m., 3.43 p.m., 4.45 p.m., 7.22
p.m., and 12.45 a.m. So numerous are the London
and "London forward" letters in the evening, that
three clerks are engaged from 5.0 p.m. to midnight
in sorting them. In the opposite direction fifty mail
bags are received from London daily, containing<!--[207.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
about 30,000 letters. Birmingham comes next in
the importance of exchange, thus: twelve mail bags
go out daily, containing 5,500 letters, and ten bags
come in, with 4,500 letters. The neighbouring city
of Bath figures next, with ten outward mail bags
daily, containing 4,200 letters, and ten inward bags,
containing 2,700 letters. The same three cities also
stand in the forefront in respect of the import and
export of parcels, 870 parcels being received from
London and 550 parcels sent thereto daily. Birmingham
sends 190 parcels and takes a like number;
whilst Bath sends 160 and takes in return 250
parcels daily.</p>

<p>The members of the permanent staff have fallen
on better days than their predecessors of old times.
They are granted holidays varying in periods
according to rank, from the twelve working days
allowed to the telegraph messengers to the month
enjoyed by the superintending officers. Medical
attendance is afforded gratuitously, and full
pay is, as a rule, given during sick absence, and
under special circumstances sick leave on full
pay is allowed for six months, and a further six
months on half-pay. After that time, if there<!--[208.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
appears to be little or no chance of recovery, a
pension or gratuity is given. The appointment of
medical officer to the Post Office was in 1862 conferred
upon Mr. F. Poole Lansdown, who has held
the post ever since. For the last four years the
average sick absence per year has been ten days for
males and seventeen days for females per head; and
during the last seven years the average mortality
amongst the established officers of the Service has
been two per annum.</p>

<p>Uniform and boots are provided by the Department
for the postmen and telegraph messengers, at an
annual cost of about &pound;2,000.</p>

<p>Good-conduct stripes are the reward to all full-time
postmen, established or unestablished, of
unblemished conduct. A stripe is awarded after
each five years' meritorious service, and each man is
eligible for six stripes, each of which carry one
shilling a week extra pay. The value of the stripes
is taken into account in calculation of pensions.</p>

<p>Of the 1,500 persons of all grades alluded to
there are in the postal department a superintendent,
24 superintending officers, and 154 male and 8
female clerks.<!--[209.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>


<p>The selection of candidates for situations in the
Bristol Post Office as sorting clerks and telegraphists,
both male and female, was for many years vested
entirely in the postmaster, and persons were given
temporary employment without passing any educational
test as to their special fitness for Post Office
employment. It so happened that not infrequently
a clerk would be employed in a temporary capacity
for some years, and finally be rejected by the
Civil Service Commissioners on educational or
medical grounds. In 1892, however, a special
preliminary educational examination was instituted.
All candidates of respectable parentage, of good
health and character, were allowed to sit at this
examination, the successful ones being taken into
the office and trained for appointment to the
Establishment. The Civil Service Examination
had, of course, to be undergone before an appointment
could be obtained. In 1896 a new system
was introduced, whereby a Civil Service certificate
had to be obtained before a person was taken
into the office. This obviated the necessity of
holding the preliminary educational examination,
but the postmaster still exercised the privilege of<!--[210.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
nominating candidates to the situations. The open
competitive system of examination was commenced
last year, and the appointments are now open to
general competition.</p>

<p>There is a term of probation in the Post Office,
and details of the duties devolving on postal clerks
may not be without interest to the Bristol public.
The business, with its multitudinous ramifications,
takes a long time to learn thoroughly. To become
a perfect all-round postal clerk a man must possess
intelligence, must be cool, fertile in expedient, have
a retentive memory, and withal be quick and active.
He must know how to primarily sort, sub-divide,
and despatch letters. He must have a good
knowledge of Post Office circulation and be able
to bear in mind the names of the smallest
places&mdash;hamlets, etc.&mdash;in the kingdom, the varying
circulations for different periods of the day, and
the rates of postage of all articles sent through
the post. Be must be able to detect the short-paid
letter, and to deal with the ordinary letter, the
large letter, the unpaid, the registered, the foreign,
the "dead," insufficiently addressed, the official,
the fragile, the insured, the postcard (single<!--[211.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and reply), the letter card, the newspaper,
the book-packet, and the circular (the definition
of which is very difficult). He is responsible
for the correct sortation of every letter that he
deals with, and he has to be expert in tying letters
in bundles. He has to cast the unpaid postage and
enter the correct account on the letter bill; take
charge of registered letter bags and loose registered
letters, and advise them on the letter bill; see to the
correct labelling, tying, and sealing of the mail bags
he makes up; check the despatch of mails on the
bag list; dispose of his letters by a given time, the
hours of the despatch of mails being fixed. In
consequence, he often has to work under great
pressure in order to finish in time. The postal clerk
has to surcharge unpaid and insufficiently prepaid
correspondence; to see that all postage stamps are
carefully obliterated, that the rules of the different
posts are not infringed; to attend to the regulations
relating to official correspondence. He has to
decipher imperfectly and insufficiently addressed
correspondence, search official and other directories
to trace proper addresses. In addition to all this
he has in turn to serve at the public counter, and<!--[212.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
there attend to money order, savings bank, postal
order, and other items of business of the kind.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the perspicacity of officers
of the Post Office in the Western Division of the
Kingdom and of the postmen of Bristol, may be
cited the circulation through the post and prompt
and safe delivery of a letter from Plymouth bearing
as its only address the magic letters "W. G.," with
cricket hat, stumps, and ball, so dear to the
individual who bears the initials.</p>

<p>Delay in delivery of articles sent by post, however,
not infrequently takes place in consequence of
misdirection. A parcel was addressed to a reverend
gentleman at "Publow Church, near Bristol," and
as it could not be presented at the fine old structure
itself, the postman took it to the adjoining vicarage,
where, in the absence of the vicar, it was taken in
by a servant upon the inference that it might be
intended for some future visitor. It turned out,
however, that the address was inaccurate, and that
the parcel was actually intended for a village some
miles from Bristol, on the other side, having for its
name Pucklechurch.</p>

<p>Occasionally there is very slow transmission in<!--[213.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
these speedy days. A rather remarkable case
occurred here of a postcard having occupied nearly
eight years in travelling between Horfield Barracks
and the premises of a firm in Stokes Croft,&mdash;a
distance of less than two miles. The missive was
posted and stamped on the 10th July, 1890, and
trace of it was lost until it turned up at Bournemouth
and received the impression of the stamp of
that office in April, 1898, whence it was sent to
Bristol and delivered. There were no other marks
to indicate its long detention.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the Post Office has to contend
with difficulties arising from want of thought on the
part of the trading community. Recently there
was a somewhat unusual occurrence at the Bristol
Post Office. A sack containing samples of biscuits
in small tin boxes was received. Around the tins
flimsy paper was tied, on which the addresses were
written. The paper had become so frayed in
transit that scarcely a single wrapper was complete,
and when the tins were turned out of the sack there
were showers of small pieces of paper like a snowstorm.
In order that the samples might reach
their destinations, the addresses were, as far as<!--[214.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
practicable, re-copied, and the samples sent out.
Nearly every one of the 500 packets received was
then sent out for delivery without delay, no doubt
to the astonishment of those who received the
biscuits in envelopes from the Returned Letter
Office.</p>

<p>In the sorting office all through the twenty-four
hours there is work going on. As one batch of
officials goes off duty another comes on, and these
relays never cease&mdash;not even on Sundays, Christmas
Days, or Bank Holidays. The sorting office is at
its busiest from 5.15 to 6.45 in the evening, and
from 8.30 p.m. till midnight. Then postmen enter
hastily, one after another, with bags from the
branch offices and pillar-boxes, which are immediately
taken charge of, opened, and the contents
shot out. The postmen rapidly arrange the small
letters face upwards, pack them in "trays" of 400,
pass them over to the stamping department; the
stampers obliterate Her Majesty's head, and record
the hour, date, and place of departure, with one
and the same stroke of the stamp, at the rate of a
hundred a minute. The stamped letters are placed
on sorting tables, where the first division takes<!--[215.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
place. Those for Bristol and neighbourhood are
assigned to a compartment for further sortation,
and the outward correspondence is sorted out into
the different "roads" by which it will travel.
Letters for small places are sent to the mail trains,
where they are sorted to their respective stations
as the locomotive is whirling them along at the
rate of fifty miles an hour. Many of the larger
towns, such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool,
Leeds, Exeter, Plymouth, Reading, Bath and
Swindon, have their own bags made up at Bristol.
Newspapers, packages, and book packets are sorted
separately, and subsequently put into their respective
bags. By-and-by the country postbags come
pouring in, and no sooner are they opened than
the letters they contain are subjected to the same
analytical treatment.</p>

<p>In a week 2,600 separate bags (or sacks containing
several bags) are sent away from the Bristol
Post Office over the Great Western and Midland
Railway systems. The weight is 21 tons, or an
average of over 18 lbs. per bag or sack. Of the
total number, 500 of the bags, with an average
weight of nearly 14 lbs. each, are for places within<!--[216.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the Bristol district, and 300 of them are sent to
London, with a total weight of 4 tons 33 lbs., or an
average of 30 lbs. per bag or sack. The bags and
sacks received in Bristol from all quarters are about
equal in number and weight to those going outwards.
Those from London weigh 6 tons 3 cwt.
44 lbs.&mdash;an average of 51 lbs each.</p>

<p>In order to simplify the disposal of the letters in
London, they are not sent up unsorted from Bristol,
but are divided into thirty-seven labelled bundles
or separate bags, a bundle or bag being made up
for each London district, for each great railway
out of London, for several foreign divisions, for
seventeen large provincial towns, and even in such
detail as for Paternoster Row and Wood Street.</p>

<p>It is not often that ships of war appear in Bristol
waters. Indeed, the old inhabitant saith that it
is fifty years since a warship anchored in the
vicinity. The recent visit of a squadron calls
therefore for a passing mention. Such an event
took place during the British Association Meeting
in September, 1898. The ironclads composing the
squadron were H.M.S. <i>Nile</i>, <i>Thunderer</i>, <i>Trafalgar</i>,
<i>Sans Pareil</i>, and the gunboat <i>Spanker</i>. The vessels<!--[217.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
anchored in Walton Bay, midway between Clevedon
and Portishead. In these pages the interest attaching
to them must necessarily be centred in their mail
arrangements. Nearly a thousand letters a day
were received at Clevedon for delivery to the fleet.
The ships' postman from each ship came ashore by
launch three times a day to fetch the letters.
Launches were specially employed to fetch telegrams
on signal being given by flag from the end of
Clevedon Pier.</p>

<p>A first aid class in connection with the St. John's
Ambulance Society was formed by members of the
Bristol Post Office staff in 1894, and there was an
average attendance of twenty members, under the
skilled direction of Dr. Bertram Rogers, of Clifton.
Of the members who presented themselves for
examination at the termination of the course of
lectures, eight were successful, and were presented
with certificates at the Society's Annual Meeting,
held at the Merchant Venturers' Technical College;
and in the following year they qualified for the
Society's much-prized medallion of efficiency. At
the conclusion of the course, Dr. Bertram Rogers
was presented with an ivory-handled and silver-mounted<!--[218.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
malacca cane, subscribed for by members
of the class. A writing-case was also presented to
Mr. Blake for organising the class.</p>

<p>The want of a gymnasium in or near the Post
Office premises is greatly felt, but the staff do not
neglect opportunities of improving their health in
other ways. Cycle Clubs have been in active
operation; the Cricket Clubs come off victorious
in many matches; and the Electric Swimming Club
has been attended with great success.<!--[219.png]-->

<h5>CHRISTMAS AND ST. VALENTINE SEASONS.</h5>


<p>A century ago the Christmas card was unthought
of; whether it will be a thing of the
past in the year 2000 cannot be foretold. The
preparations made to meet the annually recurring
pressure involve much forethought and considerable
labour, and have to be in progress for a long time
prior to Christmas. The time occupied in getting
the instructions ready for the staff and making all
arrangements incidental to the season is equivalent
to more than the entire duty of a clerk for a whole
year. Nothing whatever is left to chance; for
unless the arrangements are organised in full
detail, the work could not go on with the clock-like
smoothness which is necessary to ensure a
successful issue. At Christmas many people find a
difficulty in deciding what to give their friends.
The difficulty in the Post Office is how to convey
Christmas gifts from friend to friend, from relative<!--[220.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to relative, and the solution is found in the extensive
preparations alluded to. They consist of many
and various ways of affording means of rapid
circulation and facilitating the traffic. Thus arrangements
are made as regards London for direct
bags to be made up at Bristol for each of the
eight principal district offices, and separate bags
for the inclusion of all the London sub-district
letters throughout the day. At normal times such
bags are made up only for the night mail and
heaviest despatches. All foreign letters are sent
in separate bags, so as to keep them apart on
arrival in London from the inland Christmas
missives. Then, in the reverse direction, London
relieves the Bristol office by making a direct
bag for the tributary office of Clifton by every
mail, instead of by two mails only. To further
facilitate matters, the parcels and letters for the
environs of Bristol are kept separate from those
for town delivery at all the large offices sending
parcel baskets and mail bags here, and Bristol
reciprocates by adopting the same plan for towns
with which it exchanges mails. Even the expedient
of putting specially-lettered neck-labels on the bags<!--[221.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
to indicate their contents is adopted. Where, ordinarily,
bundles of letters are made up for particular
towns, direct bags take their places, and where,
ordinarily, letters are sent in bulk from many
towns separate bundles are made up for each
town: thus, letters from Bristol for Brighton,
which are usually dealt with in London, are
forwarded in a direct bag to pass through the
metropolis unopened. The individual attendances
of the ordinary staff are increased from eight hours
to twelve, fourteen, and sixteen hours per day. All
holidays are suspended for the time being, which
enables some telegraphists to undertake postal duty;
clerical labour is stopped, outside help is obtained,
and altogether additional labour provided for to
the extent of 50 per cent. over the normal staff.
Although there is such a large augmentation
numerically, the value of it cannot be judged in
that way, as it takes a long time to make a
really efficient postal officer, and the novices who
are engaged, although willing enough, can do little
more than undertake manual labour. Many army
reserve men and army and navy pensioners are
engaged to assist on the occasion. The weather is<!--[222.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
always a potent factor. The ordinary types of mail
vehicles, contracted for by the Bristol Tramways
Company, and always well turned out by Mr. G.
Matthews, have to be supplemented at the Christmas
season by the employment of large pair-horse
trolleys, which, are used not only for the conveyance
of mails between office and railway station, but are
also sent round the town to pick up the heavy
parcel collections from the numerous sub-offices.</p>

<p>The great unpunctuality of the mail trains which
invariably sets in early in the Christmas week
causes no little inconvenience, particularly as
regards the mails from the North of England,
and the merchants are therefore not slow to avail
themselves of the Post Office new system, under
which, for a small fee, they can get their letters
brought by delayed trains delivered by special
messenger promptly on their arrival at the Head
Post Office. The extra posting of letters and
parcels for places abroad, intended for delivery
about Christmas Day, begins to manifest itself
early in November.</p>

<p>A great number of people appear to think that
Christmas cards and other printed matter may be<!--[223.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
sent by book-post in covers which are entirely
closed, except for small slits cut at the sides.
These packets are liable to charge at letter postage
rates unless they are made up in such a manner as
will admit of the contents being easily withdrawn for
examination. To educate the public in the matter
of full prepayment, it has become necessary for the
Department to be particularly vigilant in surcharging
the Christmas missives which contravene
the regulations, and the Bristol clerks have the
unpleasant task of raising an impost on letters
during the Christmas season which infringe the
Postmaster-General's not severe regulations. The
custom of sending Christmas cards in open envelopes
is increasing.</p>

<p>With regard to telegrams, the public have
recently received at the hands of His Grace the
Duke of Norfolk the great benefit of being allowed
to have their telegraphic messages delivered up to
distances of three miles without payment of any
charge whatever for porterage. In this neighbourhood,
the concession has resulted in an increase
in the number of messages for delivery over a mile,
especially at Christmas. During the Christmas<!--[224.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
season there is always a decrease in the number
of business telegrams, but that is in some measure
made up for by a large number of telegrams being
sent by the public who are travelling to keep
holiday, and in this connection more use is made
of the telegraph than the telephone service. The
decrease in the volume of work admits of telegraphists
aiding their brother officers on the postal
side.</p>

<p>The inflow of Christmas cards is pretty evenly
dispersed over the earlier days of the season, but
the great rush comes on the night of the 23rd and
the morning of the 24th of the month. Letters up
to four ounces in weight are now conveyed at the
small cost to the public of a penny. So far as this
city is concerned, letters and book-packets over two
ounces in weight, which are now blended in one post,
are quadrupled in number at the Christmas season.
This increase in the letter packets has the effect of
retarding the postmen in effecting their deliveries,
inasmuch as they have to search in their bags for
the packages which they cannot carry tied up in
consecutive order. The trouble arising therefrom
is somewhat mitigated, however, by the circumstance<!--[225.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
that the charged letters are less numerous than
heretofore, owing to the large increase in the weight
which is now carried for a penny. The Christmas
season is departmentally regarded as consisting of
the days from the 20th of the month to Christmas
Day, the 25th, inclusive. From the most reliable
calculations that the officials are capable of making,
it would appear that during the Christmas period
no fewer than 2,000,000 letters are dropped by the
residents into the 500 receptacles dotted here and
there over Bristol's large postal area. The letters
distributed by Bristol's regular postmen, with their
250 followers, are a million and a half, in each
case about an extra week's work to be got through
in three days.</p>

<p>Some 20,000 letters and parcels find their way to
the Bristol Returned Letter Office as the flotsam
and jetsam of the Christmas postings. They consist
of letters without addresses, letters addressed
in undecipherable caligraphy, letters for people
dead, gone away, and not known; parcels of poultry
and game without name of sender or addressee.
Certainly handwriting does not improve, hence all
these failures and embarrassments to the Post Office.<!--[226.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>


<p>The articles for transmission by parcel post
handed in at the head Post Office, branch, offices,
sub-offices in town, suburbs, and villages, reach
the total of 40,000, being about four times as
numerous as at ordinary periods. The rural
districts alone produce 8,000 parcels. The parcels
delivered number 35,000, being treble ordinary
numbers. Ten thousand of these parcels are
delivered in the villages. Nearly a thousand large
hampers of parcels are exchanged between London
and Bristol, and of these some forty contain foreign
parcels alone.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the vastly increased numbers,
it becomes noticeable at Bristol, year by year, that
there is a diminution of parcels conveyed by parcel
post containing articles of good cheer: the geese,
the fowls, and the game having decreased, plum
pudding's, however, being as much in evidence as
ever. The reduction in the parcel post rates which
took place in 1897 has had a very marked effect
upon the parcel post traffic, and the increase,
particularly in the heavy weights, has been very
great. On the other hand, the reduction in the
rates of charge for the conveyance of post parcels<!--[227.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
has had the effect of bringing about a decrease in
the number of parcels weighing under 2 lb.</p>

<p>As showing that the postal deliveries at the
Christmas season are arranged as well as the extraordinary
circumstances will admit, and that the
public on its part can appreciate the difficulties to
be contended with, it may be worthy of mention
that complaints of delay are rarely made.</p>

<p>The Postmaster-General is not unmindful of his
duty in providing sustenance for his legions at the
busy season, and refreshments are supplied for the
permanent staff without stint. There are no trams
running on Christmas Day, so that the postmen with
their heavy loads are much worse off than on ordinary
days, when, with lighter loads, they can ride to and
fro on the tramcars. There are some pleasing social
features which are worthy of record. For instance,
the ladies of the Clifton Letter Mission have for
some years past sent "A Christmas Letter" and
Christmas card to each of the 150 telegraph
messengers employed in the Bristol district. The
ladies who manage the society known as the Postal
and Telegraph Christian Association invariably send
to every postman in the Bristol district a sympathetic<!--[228.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and seasonable letter, accompanied by a pretty
Christmas card and the best of all good wishes.
The staff of the Bristol Post Office usually pay the
compliments of the Christmas season to their postal
friends elsewhere in the form of a prettily-designed
card.</p>

<p>Christmas Day of 1898 is rendered memorable in
postal annals from the circumstance that on that
day the postage on letters to and from many of our
colonies and foreign possessions was reduced from
the modest sum of 2½d. per half-ounce to the still
more modest sum of 1d. per half-ounce. Bristol
has a not inconsiderable colonial and foreign correspondence.
British India takes 550 letters, etc., on
the average weekly; the Dominion of Canada, 450;
Newfoundland, 110; and Gibraltar, 100; the other
countries to which the reduced rate of postage has
been applied take 500 in the week.</p>

<p>One of the many changes that have taken place
in the manners and customs of the people as
affecting the Post Office is very noticeable as
regards the observance of St. Valentine's Day.
Thirty years ago the votaries of the patron saint,
in their thousands, vied with each other, year after<!--[229.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
year, to honour his memory, and make the Post Office
the medium of sending to every close friend some
kind of love token, ranging from the artistic production
at one guinea, down to the humble penny
fly-leaf which contained the simple but expressive
pleading, at the bottom of a neat woodcut, "O come,
true love, be mine." Only too often, however, the
day was made the occasion to strike a blow at the
fickle lover by means of some gross caricature.
On the eve of St. Valentine the energies of the staff,
which was limited as compared with now, were
formerly greatly taxed to get rid of the enormous
piles of packets which flooded the various receptacles
in the city. All this is, however, changed;
the occasion now passes by almost unnoticed in the
sorting office and by the postmen.<!--[230.png]-->

</div>

<p>The public office of the Bristol Post Office is
very commodious (50 ft. by 44 ft.), and affords
ample counter accommodation to the citizens for
properly conducting their Post Office business. It
is markedly superior as regards size and fitting-up
to almost any other provincial office, and indeed its
equal in those respects is scarcely to be found in
all London. In contrast to the spacious public
hall of the Bristol Post Office and the civility
of its clerks, the writer's first impressions of the
postal service of his country were by no means of
a pleasant character. When quite a small child,
he was entrusted by his mother with the mission of
conveying a small rose-coloured and delicately-perfumed
letter to the Post Office in a world-famed
Warwickshire town&mdash;an errand of which he was
"no end" proud. Timidly he knocked at a little
wicket in the window of the house to which he<!--[233.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
<!--[232.png]-->
was directed. Almost immediately the wicket was
thrown open, and a very red visage appeared.
"What do you want?" "Will you put a stamp
on this letter, sir, please?" "No! What the
devil do you mean by bringing letters like this?
'Tisn't big enough. It'll get lost in some hole or
corner." Frightened at this "Giant Grim," a
hasty retreat was made, and the irascible old postmaster
was left to do as he liked with letter and
penny.</p>

<p>The penny combined postage and Inland Revenue
stamp was introduced in 1881. A new series of
postage stamps was issued in 1884, and the present
series in January, 1887.</p>

<p>In the year 1833 the value of the postage
stamps obtained from London for distribution
in the Bristol district was &pound;33,844; in 1862 it
had only grown to &pound;35,720; but in 1898 it
had reached the more prodigious proportions of
&pound;171,000, of which sum those stamps of the halfpenny
denomination were of the value of &pound;30,700,
and in number 14,735,000; and the penny stamps
in value &pound;85,775 and in number 20,586,000.
Stamps of other denominations were issued<!--[234.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
thus:&mdash;1½d., 207,360; 2d., 205,920; 2½d., 207,000;
3d., 364,320; 4d., 277,680; 4½d., 16,000; 5d.,
147,120; 6d., 534,600; 9d., 51,200; 10d., 27,840;
1s., 82,320; 2s. 6d., 2,800; 5s., 2,588; 10s.,
688; 20s., 550 and &pound;5, 4. Post-cards, embossed
envelopes, newspaper wrappers, telegraph forms
and other articles of the kind were of the value of
&pound;14,334. At the earlier period the postmaster of
the day was allowed 1 per cent. on the value
of the stamps sold, in addition to his salary. It is
not so now!</p>

<p>Under the system inaugurated in 1880 the postal
orders issued and paid at the Bristol public office
counter number nearly half a million in the year.
The money orders paid at the counter preponderate
over those issued&mdash;the amounts respectively being
&pound;237,000 and &pound;34,000. These sums include the
amounts received in respect of telegraph money
orders&mdash;the Department's new departure of 1890.
The Government insurance and annuity business
commenced by the Post Office in 1865 is making
progress in Bristol, and the same may be said
of the system started in 1880 of investments in
Government stock through Post Office medium.<!--[235.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>


<p>The first Post Office Savings Bank in the district
was established at the Clifton Branch Post Office on
the 16th September, 1861, the year in which savings
bank business was commenced throughout the
country generally. Several accounts were opened
on that day, and the amount deposited was &pound;35 4s.
A similar institution was opened in the city in March,
1862, at the Money Order Office, then located in the
corner shop in Albion Chambers, Small Street,
opposite the present Head Post Office. From such
small beginnings a vast savings bank business has
grown up. The sum standing to the credit of
depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank in the
Bristol postal area at the end of 1895, when the last
account was published, was nearly &pound;2,000,000,
deposited by some 100,000 separate individuals.
The deposits made at the head office in Small Street
reached close upon &pound;400,000, and the other part of
the amount is made up thus: Gloucestershire side&mdash;Town
Post Offices, &pound;659,085; rural Post Offices,
&pound;192,934. Somersetshire side&mdash;Town Post Offices,
&pound;215,295; rural Post Offices, &pound;91,944. The estimated
amount due to depositors in the Post Office Savings
Banks throughout the whole country on the 21st<!--[236.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
December, 1898, was &pound;123,155,000, and the amount
due to trustees of Savings Banks on November 20th,
1898,&mdash;the latest date on which the figures were
made up&mdash;was &pound;50,634,655. The Bristol Savings
Bank was closed in 1888, and its 12,814 accounts
were transferred to the Post Office Savings Bank.
The amount of money involved was a little over
half a million.</p>

<p>During Mr. Fawcett's administration at the Post
Office, thrift on the part of the nation was encouraged
in every possible way. Then was inaugurated the
now familiar system for facilitating the placing of
small sums in the Post Office Savings Bank by
means of postage stamps affixed to a Post Office
form as penny after penny is saved until an amount
of one shilling is reached, the minimum for a Post
Office Savings Bank deposit.</p>

<p>A case occurred at a Bristol Post Office fifteen
years since, in which a young servant girl, in her
desire to be thrifty under the system alluded to,
craftily obtained the key of the letter box from
the secret place in which the sub-postmaster kept
it, and abstracted a number of circular letters on
School Board business, and took off the stamps for<!--[237.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
attachment to the Savings Bank slips. She was
sentenced to a term of imprisonment, which, on
account of her youth, was limited to six months.</p>

<p>Amusing incidents sometimes occur to break the
monotony of counter work. For instance, a woman
applied for a postal order, and when it was handed
to her, the clerk, acting upon the official instructions,
recommended the good lady to take the number
before sending the order away. A few days afterwards
she appeared at the Post Office with the order
and complained that payment had been refused
because the order had been mutilated. The clerk
on examining the order found that the direction to
"take the number of the order" had been acted on
literally. The number had been carefully cut out,
and retained in the possession of the applicant. It
was some time before she could be made to realize
her mistake. In another instance early one fine
autumn morn a young couple presented themselves
at the public office of the Bristol Post Office and
begged in earnest language that they might be
supplied with a marriage license. The request could
not, of course, be complied with, but the applicants,
much to their satisfaction, were informed where they<!--[238.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
could obtain the needed document. On another
occasion some money was observed on the counter,
and on the very small child near it being asked
what was required, "Two ounces of tea and a
pound of sugar" were at once demanded. This
mistake no doubt arose from the fact that the
business carried on in the late Post Office building
in Exchange Avenue is that of a tea dealer. It
is a rule of the Service that letters should not be
delivered from the <i>Poste Restante</i> except to the
actual addressees or to other persons bearing
authority to receive the letters on behalf of the
addressees. A request was made at the Bristol Head
Post Office for the delivery of letters to a person
other than the addressee, which person could not
produce the necessary authority to act as recipient.
The excuse given for non-production of authority
was that the addressee was asleep. The enquirer
having been advised to get authority when the
addressee awoke, rather astonished the counter clerk
by saying that such awaking would not take place
until Saturday, the day of application being
Tuesday. It transpired that the application was
made in respect of letters for a person who was<!--[239.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
undergoing a state of hypnotism at a Bristol music
hall. The touching incident occurred at the Bristol
Post Office of a poor woman&mdash;pressing want having
come upon her at last&mdash;who had to withdraw a
shilling which she had thirty years previously
deposited in a trustee savings bank which was
taken over by the Post Office. She had to receive
one penny by way of interest for the use of her
mite for thirty years. Some years since a collector
of old issues of crown-pieces presented seventy of
such coins, in a good state of preservation, at the
Bristol Post Office counter as a Savings Bank deposit.
The depositor, after taking the trouble to accumulate
these old coins, had come to the conclusion that an
annual interest of eight shillings and sixpence would
be more useful to him than an occasional inspection
of the coins. Few people know so little about Post
Office matters as an individual from over the Severn
who recently asked for a postage stamp. "Do you
want a penny or a halfpenny stamp?" asked the
clerk. "I want a South Wales stamp," was the
reply of Taffy. Then the surprise of the counter
officer must have been great when, on counting up
his money, he found that on one of the shillings<!--[240.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the legend "Baby" boldly appeared impressed
where the Queen's head is usually found, the coin
having evidently been used as a brooch.</p>

<p>The Department, in communicating with the
public, prescribes that its officers should subscribe
themselves as the public's most obedient servants,
and on some of the printed forms which have to
be returned in answer to queries raised by the
Department the same style is adopted for the
public to use. One dignified gentleman returned
his form, from which he had erased "Your
obedient servant" and substituted "Yours respectfully,"
adding a marginal note to the effect that
he was not the servant of the Department, but that
the Department was his servant.</p>

<p>The postmaster of Bristol is addressed by the
public in various ways, as for instance: "Postmaster
General," "General Postmaster," "Bristol
Postmaster," "H.M. Chief Postmaster," "To the
Postmaster in State, Small Street, Bristol," "Head
Post-Master and Surveyor of the Bristol District,"
"Head Master, Post Office," "Post Office Master,"
"Postmaster-in-General," "Master General, Post-Office,"
"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, Esq., Post M.G.," "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,<!--[241.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Esq., Post Office General," "To the Reverend Sir
Postmaster, Bristol, England."</p>

<p>It is astonishing how many Foreigners and
Colonists apply to the Bristol Post Office respecting
their relations, or for information as regards trading
matters. The former questions are sometimes
answered, but the latter are handed over to the
courteous secretary of the Chamber of Commerce
to deal with.</p>

<p>Very unusual was the circumstance of the receipt
at the Bristol Post Office in 1895, anonymously, of
a sum of ten shillings in postage stamps as conscience
money, and, oddly enough, the next day
threepence in stamps was received in the same
anonymous manner and for the same purpose.
These two instances were the first and the last.</p>

exemplified by an article which appeared in a
monthly magazine as follows, viz.:&mdash;</p>

night at the General Post Office, Bristol, a spirited
mare attached to the red mail-cart is brought, at a
quarter before midnight, to fetch the bags of letters,
&amp;c. She stands perfectly still, waiting while the
mails are sealed and tossed one by one into the
vehicle. At the five minutes before twelve, however,
should all not be ready for departure, her
driver sings out 'Any more for the down train?' by
way of hurrying the officials. No sooner does the
mare hear those words than she begins to dance
and curvet, showing in every possible way her
anxiety to start and her sense of the importance of
her duties. But if by any chance the first stroke of
midnight should sound before they are ready to
proceed to the station, she takes matters into her
own hands, and nothing will then hold her in.
Those who have to do with this clever and beautiful
creature are very proud of her, on account of
the example she sets of punctuality and attention
to the affairs of the nation."</p>

<p>The real facts on which this incident is founded
were, that the horse (not mare) remained in the
Post Office yard quietly from 11.10 p.m. until<!--[243.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
midnight on one particular night only, and not
generally, and when the loading of the van commenced
the horse became restive, the final slamming
of the van doors causing it to start off for the street.
In consequence of a repetition of this restlessness on
another night, and "kicking-in" the front of the
van, the horse was taken off the Royal Mail
Service.<!--[244.png]-->

<h5>TELEGRAPHS, TELEPHONES, EXPRESS DELIVERY.</h5>


<p>The Saxon King, Edmund I., doubtless never
conceived, when he held court (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 940-946)
at his palace in the village of Pucklechurch, seven
miles from Bristol, that in generations to come
there would exist, as there does now, a telegraph
office within a few yards of the site of his castle,
whence a question could be wired to the ends of
the earth, and a reply obtained in the short space
of a few hours. Probably at that remote period
a journey from Pucklechurch to the north of
Scotland would have been considered as great an
achievement as that in recent days of Dr. Nansen
in his endeavour to get to the North Pole.</p>

<p>The first actual working telegraph was erected
in 1838 between Paddington and West Drayton on
the Great Western Railway, and in the following
year Wheatstone and Cook constructed a telegraph
line from Paddington to Slough. Mr. Brunel then<!--[245.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
wished to extend the line to this city, but the
shareholders would not support him to that extent.
In 1852, however, the Great Western
Railway Board had the line constructed through
to Bristol. By means of it messages could, at that
later date, be forwarded to and from most parts
of the kingdom from the office at the Bristol
Railway Station. Arrangements were put in progress
for extending the wires into the centre of
the city, in order that greater facilities might be
afforded to those parties who might wish to
avail themselves of the means of inter-communication,
and before the end of the year the wires
were laid from the railway station to the Commercial
Rooms, and subsequently three telegraph offices
were opened in the city, viz.: the Electric and
International, on the Exchange; the Magnetic, in
Exchange Avenue; and the United Kingdom, in
Corn Street. A telegraph line was laid to Shirehampton,
and the committee of the Commercial
Rooms subscribed &pound;30 a year towards its maintenance.</p>

<p>It is recorded that in 1859 the firm of Messrs.
W. D. and H. O. Wills, tobacconists and snuff<!--[246.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
manufacturers of this city, laid down an electric
telegraph wire between their warehouse in Maryport
Street and their manufactory in Redcliff Street,
whereby the partners and employ&eacute;s, although
engaged in different parts of the city, were enabled
to converse with each other as readily as if occupying
the same counting-house. The wire was used
solely for their own business.</p>

<p>In 1862 a turnpike road telegraph was spoken
of as being in course of construction between
Bristol and Birmingham.</p>

<p>Mr. James Robertson, the senior assistant superintendent
o&pound; the Bristol Telegraph Office, during
his forty-two years' service, thirteen of which were
passed in the employment of the Electric and
International Telegraph Company, has had many
experiences. He has culled from his "ancient
history" the fact that the amount of telegraph
business transacted by the E. and I. T. Co. at
Falmouth, Plymouth, Bristol, and London (Lothbury,
head office) on March 10th, 1858, at the
respective times of day stated, was:&mdash;Falmouth,
8 messages, handed in by 10.20 a.m.; Plymouth
at 10.36 had managed to transmit 7; Bristol, at<!--[247.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
noon, 39; and Lothbury had received 116 by 12.17
p.m. Plymouth transmitted for Falmouth, and
Bristol for Plymouth. Bain's chemical recorder
was the system used on the Falmouth wire, the
double needle on the Plymouth and Bristol, and
"Bains" and needles on Bristol-London circuits.
The average delay on messages at Plymouth was
eighty-three minutes and at Bristol fourteen minutes.
The charge at the time from Falmouth to London
was four shillings for twenty words, addresses
free. The present proprietor of <i>Lloyd's Newspaper</i>,
Mr. Thomas Catling, records an incident in which
Mr. Robertson was concerned. Mr. Catling was
the only London newspaper reporter who visited
Windsor on the eventful night when the deeply
lamented Prince Consort breathed his last on
14th December, 1861. On reaching Windsor by
the last train from London he learned that His
Royal Highness had passed away about twenty
minutes previously. Having obtained at the Castle
particulars of the sad event, Mr. Catling hunted
out the residence of the clerk of the Electric and
International Telegraph Company. On ringing him
up, the clerk pleaded that before going to bed he<!--[248.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
had been taking gruel and hot water to get rid
of a bad cold. He, however, got up and proceeded
with Mr. Catling to the telegraph office in High
Street, whence intelligence was wired to London.
Mr. Catling preserved the receipt of that message
as a souvenir of the occasion. Mr. Robertson
was the telegraph clerk who arose from his bed
to perform the service in the dead of night.</p>

<p>On the transfer of the telegraph business from
the companies to the State early in 1870, the
Post Office, Bristol, engaged sixteen clerks from
the Electric and International Telegraph Company,
five from the United Kingdom Company, and six
from the Magnetic Company. Additional clerks
were employed by the Post Office as soon as the
volume of work could be gauged, but in the meantime
the transferred clerks had to do practically
double duty. The officials taken over from the
companies were located in the Small Street Post
Office, but it was not until January, 1872, that
room could be found there for the entire staff,
which had then grown to be ninety clerks and fifty
messengers. The telegraphic system soon after the
Government took to it was extended in this district<!--[249.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
to twenty of the principal villages. In the first year
of Post Office working there were 450,000 messages
dealt with here, and now the yearly number is
3,500,000. The sixpenny telegram was introduced
in 1885. The local telegraph service now has a
staff consisting of a superintendent, 23 superintending
officers, 140 male and 44 female telegraphists,
eight telephonists, and 155 telegraph messengers.
Telegrams are delivered from the head office, two
branch offices, fifteen town sub-offices, forty rural
sub-offices, and four railway stations. The head
office has 600,000 messages delivered from it
annually, the branch and town sub-offices 220,000,
and the rural districts 74,000. Of the latter
(74,000), about 8,000 are delivered at distances of
from one to three miles, and 350 at distances over
three miles. After 8.0 p.m. all the messages in
the town area are delivered from the head office.
The Duke of Norfolk's 1897 concession of free
delivery of telegrams for all distances under three
miles has been appreciated by all those concerned.</p>

<p>The telegraph gallery has direct telegraphic
connection with the undermentioned towns: Bath,
Birmingham, Bridgwater, Cardiff, Cheltenham,<!--[250.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Chippenham, Clevedon, Cork, Exeter, Glasgow,
Gloucester, Guernsey, Jersey, Leeds, Liverpool,
London, Manchester, Newport (Mon.), Oxford,
Plymouth, Reading, Southampton, Swansea,
Swindon, Taunton, and Weston-super-Mare, and
thirty-two smaller towns.</p>

<p>Bristol plays a not unimportant part in the Post
Office telephone trunk line system, commenced in
1896. It has direct trunk lines to Bath, Birmingham,
Cardiff, Exeter, Gloucester, London, Newport,
Sharpness, Taunton, and Weston-super-Mare. The
conversations held by the public through the
medium of these lines number 4,000 weekly.</p>

<span class="caption">The Telegraph Instrument Room, Bristol Post Office.</span><br />
<i style='font-size: small'>From a photograph by Mr. Protheroe, Wine Street, Bristol.</i>
</div>

<p>The well-ventilated and well-lighted telegraph
instrument room is on the upper floor, and extends
from end to end of the building. In it there are
102 telegraph instruments of various kinds in use,
viz.: 5 A.B.C.'s, 19 double-plate sounders, 30
sounders, 28 duplexes, 5 quadruplexes, 5 Wheatstone
sets, 7 repeaters or relays, 2 concentrators
and 1 hexode. Divested of technicalities, it may be
said that telegraphing on the A.B.C. instruments
is effected by alphabetic manipulative keys, which
are depressed by the fingers of the left hand of the<!--[253.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
<!--[252.png]-->
sender at the same time that a handle is turned
with the right hand, and a corresponding effect is
produced on the dial plate of the receiver. The
double-plate sounder is read by sound from two
small metal hands striking right and left against
two pieces of metal. In sending, the working is
by means of keys manipulated by the hand. The
sending upon the sounder instrument, which is that
chiefly used, is done by a small key with handle
being depressed and released according to the dots
and dashes of the Morse alphabet. The signals by
which messages are received and read by the ear
are produced by a bar of soft iron striking upon a
steel point placed between two coils of wire. With
the A.B.C., double-plate sounder, and sounder, only
one message can be sent or received on the wire at
one time; but the duplex sounder instruments are so
constructed that two messages can be sent on the
wire&mdash;one in each direction&mdash;at the same time.
Double-current duplex instruments are in use for
telegraphing to busy towns such as Plymouth,
Exeter, Cardiff, Swansea, &amp;c., &amp;c. The quadruplex
consists of two duplex sets upon one wire. Upon
these circuits two distinct messages may be sent<!--[254.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
simultaneously from each end. The hexode has six
instruments at each end of a single wire, enabling
twelve clerks to operate at the same time&mdash;six at
each end,&mdash;and thus admits of a single wire doing
so much work as six wires worked with the ordinary
sounder instrument.</p>

<p>At times of pressure when race meetings are
going on, or during the cricket and football seasons,
the ordinary methods of working are supplemented
by extraordinary means, thus: the duplex working
between Bristol and Manchester is augmented by
Manchester connecting there a Bristol wire with a
Newcastle wire: Newcastle in like manner further
connecting the line with Glasgow, Glasgow with
Edinburgh, Edinburgh with Dundee, and Dundee
with Aberdeen. Then at the Bristol end, instead
of working by means of the ordinary keys, Wheatstone
working is resorted to, viz.: the messages
instead of being "keyed" are "punched," the
punching process being performed by means of
iron punching sticks upon an apparatus called the
"perforator." The sticks are rapidly worked by
skilful operators upon three steel keys, which, when
struck, mechanically draw a strip of white paper tape,<!--[255.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
at the same time perforating holes which indicate
signs in accordance with the Morse alphabet system.
These slips thus "punched"&mdash;which, by-the-by,
very much resemble the perforated slips used in
connection with the organette instrument&mdash;are
passed through a Wheatstone "transmitter," and
buzzed through so rapidly that 400 or 500 words
can be sent in a minute. The signals are simultaneously
reproduced upon blue slips in the form
of dots and dashes at Manchester, at Newcastle,
at Glasgow, at Edinburgh, at Dundee, and at
Aberdeen. The message recorded on the slips is
broken off at about every hundred words to form
a "press" page at the receiving offices for writing
up by the telegraphists, a large number of whom
can be employed on the work at the same time.
When this process is resorted to the battery power
for the wire has to be greatly increased. The
repeater instruments are worked in like manner,
except that the system is permanent instead of
occasional. The concentrator is a recent invention,
and is used for the purpose of economising
force and apparatus, and of minimising delay and
table space. By its means the wires for eighteen<!--[256.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
to twenty offices, which use the same form of
telegraphic instrument, are led into a special
switch-board, and each wire as it is required is
"switched" through to a telegraph instrument,
at which a clerk is ready to send or receive the
message. Thus the telegraphist is "fed" by the
operator at the concentrator, and has to send a
message to any one of the thirty towns instead of,
under ordinary working, to only three or four towns.</p>

<p>In place of over 700 batteries with 3,500 cells of
the Bichromate, Daniel and Leclanche type in use at
the Bristol telegraph office for many years, a system
of accumulators or storage batteries has been
brought into operation. The power for charging
the accumulators is generated on the spot by a
Crossley's gas engine driving a dynamo. The
accumulators number 250, and each has seven
divisions. The hexode instrument between Bristol
and London requires a voltage of 400 dry cells.
There are two complete sets of accumulators, each
with separate connecting wires to the instrument
room. One set is in use at a time. The system
of accumulators has been introduced for the
purposes of economy and saving of space.<!--[257.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>


<p>It may be interesting to the uninitiated to learn
that in telegraphy the earth plays the part
of a return wire; thus the circuit between Bristol
and Birmingham is rendered complete by earth.
The wires connected with the two towns indicated
are brought into the test boxes at the respective
places, and there connected to a single wire at
each town which finds earth by means of a zinc
plate buried some twelve feet in the soil near or
under the Post Office buildings.</p>

<p>Occasionally when people have been out for a
drive or a cycle ride, and their eyes have been
delighted with the grand scenery to be found
around Bristol, they look, as they journey homewards,
to the Government poles and to the many
wires therefrom suspended, and wonder which are
telegraph wires, which are telephone wires, where
they all lead to, and between what points messages
are sent and conversations held. Such travellers
returning to Bristol by way of Almondsbury would
see the wires on the one side (telegraphs), which run
from Bristol to Falfield, Newport, Cardiff, Swansea,
Gloucester, Liverpool; London to Swansea, Newport,
and Cardiff; Birmingham to Exeter; Plymouth to<!--[258.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Liverpool; and (telephones) Bristol to Birmingham,
Gloucester, Cardiff; and on the other side of the
road (telephones) Horfield, Fylton, Almondsbury,
Newport, Cardiff, Gloucester and Birmingham. In
some instances there are two or three wires for the
same place. The telegraph, and telephone wires
cross and recross each other at frequent intervals
along the road, and the whole sets of wires cross
from side to side of the road between Fylton and
Almondsbury.</p>

<p>Alternative routes for the wires are adopted where
practicable, so that in case of a break-down on one
line communication may be kept up on the other.</p>

<p>By way of illustration of such alternate routes, it
may be mentioned that the two wires from the Head
Post Office in Small Street for Swansea run underground
to Stapleton Road, at which point they are
brought above ground and diverge, one running to
Wee Lane, thence to Ashley Hill, Horfield, Almondsbury,
Alveston Ship, Falfield and Berkeley, up to
the Severn Bridge; and the other branching off at
the end of Stapleton Road, and carried along the
Fishponds and Chipping Sodbury roads nearly to
Yate, and down the Tortworth road to just beyond<!--[259.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Falfield, where it joins the other Swansea and South
Wales wires, and passes over the Severn Bridge into
Wales.</p>

<p>The telegraph and telephone wires in this district
are chiefly erected and maintained by soldiers of the
Royal Engineers. Sixteen military telegraphists,
members of the Royal Engineers, are attached to the
Bristol Post Office, and kept in training for telegraph
service with the army. Twelve of them are now&mdash;November,
1899&mdash;in South Africa on active service,
in connection with the troubles in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>In the great hurricane which occurred in January,
1899, the telephone and telegraph wires radiating
from Bristol were blown down in all directions. In
consequence Bristol was entirely cut off from direct
telephonic communication with Birmingham for 21
hours, and had only one wire instead of two for 9¼
hours; from Bath for 18 hours, and had only one
wire instead of two for 5½ hours; from Cardiff for
18 hours, and had only two wires instead of three
for 10½ hours; from Weston-super-Mare entirely
for 24½ hours; from Taunton for 28½ hours; from
Exeter for 27 hours; from Sharpness for 26 hours.
There was only one wire instead of two to Gloucester<!--[260.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
for 26¼ hours, to London for 6 hours, and to Newport
for 20¾ hours.</p>

<p>The trunk telephone lines were more or less
interrupted for a week, caused by the working
parties engaged on repairs.</p>

<p>The telegraph wires for the counties of Gloucester,
Somerset, Monmouth, Warwick, Shropshire, Worcester,
Wilts, Devon, Cornwall and Lancashire were
those chiefly deranged.</p>

<p>It is believed that there is only one telegraph
cable in the Bristol district, and that cable does not
belong to the Postmaster-General. It crosses the
river Avon at a point adjacent to Pill and Shirehampton,
and was used by the Commercial Rooms
in connection with reports of the arrival of vessels.
Up to the time of its introduction, as already stated,
"warners" were employed. The last of the old
running "warners" were Gerrish and Case. These
men lived at Pill, and on hearing news from pilots-men
of the arrival of a ship in the Bristol Channel
they started off on foot to Bristol and <i>warned</i> the
merchants and wives of sailors of the vessel's arrival
in the Channel, getting, of course, fees for their
trouble,&mdash;a guinea from the merchants, and so on,<!--[261.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
down to the shillings of the sailors' wives,&mdash;and fifty
years ago these fees were willingly paid, and the
heavy postages too. The runners were men of some
little mark.</p>

<p>The Post Office at Avonmouth, a Bristol sub-office,
is much used for telegraph purposes by persons on
board vessels passing up and down the Kingroad in
the Bristol Channel. The Bristol Corporation placed
outside the port a large white notice board with
"<span class="smcap">TELEGRAPH OFFICE</span>" painted upon it in black letters,
to attract the attention of mariners. The messages
are chiefly received from vessels with cargoes consigned
to Sharpness, which in neap tides have often
to lie in the roads for days.</p>

<p>Telegrams for vessels lying in Kingroad are often
taken out by boat at midnight or in the early hours
of the morning. This is often in consequence of
the tide not serving, or being too strong for the
boatman to go out at seasonable hours.</p>

<p>Lundy Island, in the Bristol Channel, is connected
with the mainland by a submarine cable, which is
considered to be one of the most perfect of its kind.
Letters for Lundy, from Bristol and elsewhere, are
carried across by boat from Instow once a week. The<!--[262.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
nearer small islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm
have cable telephonic communication with Weston-super-Mare.
The telephone, which is carried into
the Weston Post Office, is rented by the War Office
Authorities, who allow the islanders the use of it.
Letters from Bristol for the Flat Holm are conveyed
by way of Cardiff. The island is rented from the
Cardiff Corporation by a farmer who resides upon it.
His son, who lives in Cardiff, daily visits the island
in a yacht, and conveys the letters for the Trinity
House officials and residents. For the Steep Holm,
Bristol letters are sent from Weston-super-Mare; the
services to the island being tri-weekly&mdash;Tuesday,
Thursday and Saturday,&mdash;and are performed by a
contractor, who goes across on behalf of the War
Office. The Steep Holm is inhabited by military
men only. In a manuscript of 30th March, 1825,
it is described as "Stipe Holme." One of the first
serious efforts in connection with the plan of telegraphing
through space without connecting wires
was conducted between the diminutive island of
Flat Holm and the shore, a distance of about five
miles; and between Penarth and Brean Down, a
distance of nine miles. An interesting illustration<!--[263.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of the system of wireless telegraphy was given,
under the direction of Mr. W. H. Preece, C.B.,
F.R.S. (now Sir W. H. Preece, K.C.B., F.R.S.),
at the Clifton College conversazione, held in honour
of the learned British Associates during the meeting
of the Association at Bristol in 1898.</p>

<p>The telegraph staff have seldom had their skill
and smartness more thoroughly tested than on the
memorable Monday evening in February, 1893,
when press messages of great length relating to the
introduction of the Home Rule Bill were sent over
the wires. Twenty minutes after Mr. Gladstone
rose to speak in the House of Commons the first
instalment of the special summary of his speech
reached this city. The conclusion of the summary
was received at two minutes to 7. The verbatim
report commenced to arrive at 4.49, and the last
instalment reached the Bristol Office at 8 o'clock.
The total number of words in the messages sent to
Bristol was nearly 40,000.</p>

<p>During the early potato season telegraphing is
very brisk with Jersey. Bristol is the only large
office besides London which has direct communication
with the island. Some idea may be gathered<!--[264.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of the extra labour entailed on the telegraph service
from the fact that in the month of June, 1899, no
fewer than 20,904 telegrams passed between Bristol
and Jersey, the normal number being only 5,800
monthly. Five or six telegraph operators are
usually sent during the season to Jersey from
Bristol.</p>

<p>In Bristol about 700 firms use abbreviated
telegraphic addresses.</p>

<p>The telegraph money order system, started in
1889, is exhibiting marvellous developments in the
local service.</p>

<p>The express letter delivery service, which came
into operation in 1891, is very useful to the public.
By means of this agency the Post Office distributes
by express messenger 300,000 letters and parcels
annually. Of that number Bristol contributes
7,000 services. Bicycles and tricycles are now
delivered for the public from any telegraph office
in Bristol and district by special messenger at a fee
of 3d. per mile, without any charge for weight.
The messengers are not permitted to ride upon the
cycles, except by the permission of the senders,
but will wheel them up to a distance of three miles.<!--[265.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>


<p>An express delivery messenger has been used,
ere now, for the convoy of a traveller from point
to point in a town unknown to him or her. The
Post Office is often required to assist even more
closely in the domestic relations of life. Recently a
gentleman from America wrote to the Clifton Post
Office to enquire whether a certain near relative
of his could be found, as he was very anxious to
see her before return to America. He enclosed a
shilling stamp for a reply by telegraph, and begged
for urgency. The relative was found and her
address given. The applicant's ardour to see his
relative cooled, or his stay in the country was
abridged, for instead of paying the proposed visit,
he begged the Post Office officials to expend five
shillings, which he sent, in the purchase of cut
roses for his relative. Of course, this was outside the
round of Post Office duties, but the clerks obligingly
attended to it, with the aid of a telegraph
messenger who was off duty at the moment.</p>

<p>Occasional mistakes are not to be wondered at
when people write illegibly. Through the improper
formation of the capital letter, D, in the proper
name Dyster, has in telegraphing been turned into<!--[266.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
O, and the name made Oyster, with the result of
misdelivery of the telegram to a firm of fishmongers
having "Oyster" as an abbreviated address. It
must have been extremely painful to an anxious
parent to receive a telegram summoning him to a
nursing home far distant, in terms that his "sow
was worse," and begging him to come at once;
the telegraphist having made the slight mistake of
transcribing "w" for "n." The gentleman who sent
a telegram to his town house in the West End of
London asking that his covert coat might be
forwarded to him was no doubt considerably
astonished when his butler returned the telegram
to him by post asking for an explanation, and
he found that the text of it was "Pigs, <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>,
and 8/-." The error was occasioned in connection
with the use of multiple addresses for a bacon-trading
firm's telegrams. In another instance a
curious complication resulted through imperfect
spacing on the part of the signalling telegraphist,
thus:&mdash;A telegram written by the sender as "To
----, Fore St., Northam, Bideford. Be in
attendance Public Offices," was transcribed thus:&mdash;"To &mdash;&mdash; forest,
Northam, Bideford. Be in at<!--[267.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
ten dance Public Offices," and, owing to the
number of words counting the same as the number
signalled, the inaccuracy was not discovered until
a repetition had been obtained from the office of
origin on application of the addressee. It was
printed in a Midland newspaper that at the
presentation of a sword of honour to the Sirdar
the Common Councilmen attended in their "margarine
gowns," and, of course, the error of using
"margarine" for "mazarine" was put down to
the carelessness of the telegraph clerk. A telegram
was sent indicating arrival at 8 Mostyn Crescent,
in a favourite North Wales town. At one stage
in transmission "Mostyn" became converted into
"mostly," and at the next office of transmission
"Crescent" became "pleasant," and the telegram
when delivered read "Arrived 8 mostly pleasant."
The Prime Minister who had informed his audience
that "there was no prospect of an immediate
general election, that they had a working majority,
and the Government was of good cheer," would not
have been pleased had he seen that the last word in
the telegram posted up in the Bristol Commercial
Rooms had been transcribed as "of good cheek."<!--[268.png]-->

<p>A telegram, "Have arranged for Sunday. Dening,"
with the first two words struck out, and "arrangement
complete" substituted underneath, was handed
in at a telegraph office by a well-known and
much respected Bristol clergyman. At the forwarding
office the message was unfortunately read
"For Sunday Dinning arrangement complete," the
erasure and addition not having been properly
understood and the proper name misspelt. At
the delivering office the message again suffered
alteration, and became "For Sunday dining
arrangements complete." It may readily be supposed
that the addressee was somewhat astonished
at the peculiar text of the message.</p>

<p>The following is from the Bristol <i>Times and
Mirror</i> of February, 1893, and has reference to
a little inaccuracy on the part of a telegraph
assistant employed at a Bristol sub-post office.
The incident itself is correctly reported:&mdash;"Garraways,
12 o'clock. Dear Mrs. B.&mdash;Chops and
tomato sauce. Yours Pickwick," settled the hash
of a well-known character; and a wire, "Going to
Bath to meet girl. Not back to dinner," had,
very nearly, a similar effect on the domestic<!--[269.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
relations of one of the smartest solicitors in our
city. The telegraph has had, in its time, much
to answer for, "but never aught like this."
When Puck said: "I'll put a girdle round about
the earth in forty minutes," he little thought
what mischief he might do. It was only the
other day we read how a stray dropped line
destroyed a horse, killed a cow, and cut off the
head of a nigger; but these accidents were a
trifle compared with what might have happened
if the message first quoted could not have been
explained. The learned gentleman it appears has
a brother, by name Gilbert, familiarly known in
the circle as "Gil." The latter, having business
in Bath, wrote asking his relative to dine with
him at the "Christopher." The learned advocate
at once accepted; but, being a thoroughly domesticated
man, telegraphed to his better-half: "Going
to Bath to meet Gil; not back to dinner." Then
came in the "cussedness" of the wire which substituted
"girl" for "Gil," and hence the temporary
ructions when the happy husband, having succeeded
with his latchkey, sought repose.<!--[270.png]-->

<h5>TELEGRAPH MESSENGERS.</h5>


<p>The telegraph messengers in uniform employed
in the Bristol district number about 160. They
have a literary institute, a drum and fife band,
hold swimming classes, etc. That there is need
of night classes may be inferred from the following
specimens of telegraph messengers' orthography and
syntax:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) "Supt, Sir, I will try to be more careful in
the pass. Yours obed, H. P&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>(2) "Supt, Sir, I having asked where the message
was ment for and they told me to go up the road
where I should see a chemist shop where I should
find it about there and I having could not find it I
asked, a gentleman which he said it was farther up
the road and I left it with cotton the undertaker
which he said it was quite right.&mdash;G. H&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>(3) "Supt, sir, I will try to be more extint in the
future as this is the truth.&mdash;M. T&mdash;&mdash;."<!--[271.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>


<p>(4) "Supt, Sir, I much regret not returning my
report But I left it home in my other Pocket in
my overcoat which is home drying which was wet
through on Saturday last. Yours obed H. E&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>The institute was inaugurated at a public meeting
at the Colston Hall on the 1st December, 1892,
which was attended by a large and influential
gathering of citizens. Upon the platform were the
Mayor of Bristol (Mr. W. R. Barker), who presided,
the Very Rev. the Dean of Bristol (Dr. Pigou), Mr.
Charles Townsend, M.P., Rev. R. Cornall, Mr. R. C.
Tombs (the postmaster), Mrs. R. C. Tombs, Dr.
Lansdown, jun., Miss Synge, Miss Pollock, Messrs.
John Harvey, Arthur Baker, E. G. Clarke, H. Lewis,
C. H. Tucker, R. L. Leighton, W. H. Lindrea, J. R.
Bennett, E. Sampson; also Messrs. A. J. Flewell
(superintendent of the telegraph department),
W. H. Gange, J. Robertson, J. S. Gover, J. J.
Mackay, H. T. Carter (superintendent of the postal
department).</p>

<p>It was explained that the telegraph messengers
were engaged at from thirteen to fourteen years of
age, and the lessons they had learned at school
had chiefly been supplemented by a knowledge<!--[272.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
acquired in the streets. The object was to counteract
street influences by providing elementary
instruction, recreation, and interesting literature.
There was no desire to educate the boys to such
a pitch that Jack would think himself better than
his master, but to take care that they should not
degenerate. It was announced that the hours of
labour had just been reduced from sixty-two to
fifty per week, which would be a great boon to
the boys. It was further stated that a private
appeal had been made, not in vain, to a few of
Bristol's most generous citizens, and that through
their kindly aid, with subscriptions from the
members of the staff and the grant which it was
hoped to earn from the Education Department, the
institute would be carried on without pecuniary
embarrassment. The description of the institute's
work was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The institute would be open to the telegraph
messengers and to junior officers of the postal and
telegraph service, the charge to each member to be
one penny per week.</p>

<p>2. The institute would be carried on in a room
at the General Post Office.<!--[273.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>


<p>3. In connection with the institute an evening
school would be held, the educational session to
last from October to May. An annual examination
of the members of the classes would be held.</p>

<p>4. In addition to the three elementary subjects,&mdash;reading,
writing, and arithmetic,&mdash;classes would
be arranged for the study of Scripture, geography,
drawing, composition, and shorthand.</p>

<p>5. For the purpose of recreation certain games
would be provided.</p>

<p>6. In connection with the institute there would be
a library, which had been formed by means of books
generously given by the citizens of Bristol.</p>

<p>7. The library would be open to any established
or unestablished officer of the postal and telegraph
service at a slight subscription per month.</p>

<p>8. A penny savings bank would also be started.</p>

<p>The Chairman said he gladly consented, to preside
that evening, because the object of the meeting was
one in which he took deep interest, and one which
he felt sure would commend itself to a very large
number of his fellow-citizens. He thought he
might say that everything connected with the postal
service was peculiarly interesting to them all, and<!--[274.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
anything they could do to ameliorate the lot of
those who daily rendered them such important
service they would be very glad to do. He thought
it would not be well to make the movement too
"goody" in its character, or too educational, so he
was glad to see that there was a lighter side to the
scheme.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Townsend, M.P., Mr. Arthur Baker,
Mr. Harold Lewis, Miss Synge, and members of
the postal and telegraph, staff, also spoke.</p>

<p>Then, the Dean of Bristol addressed the telegraph
messengers, and said he really should have been
disappointed if he had not been invited to attend
the meeting. It was a pleasant part of his
privilege in ministering in Bristol to be asked to
take a share in such an interesting gathering as
they were holding that evening. One of the best
features of this institute was that it would assist
them to put their leisure to the most profitable
use.</p>

<p>The educational work has been progressing
steadily ever since its inauguration, and much
good has resulted from it to the messengers.</p>

<p>Ever ready to give their countenance to entertainments<!--[275.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
for the benefit of the community, their
Graces the late lamented Duke, and the Dowager
Duchess, of Beaufort, as their first public act after
coming to reside at Stoke Park, near our city,
attended a concert at the Redland Park Hall,
which was held for the purpose of benefiting the
funds of the Telegraph Messengers' Institute.
Later on, May 21st, 1898, they were kind enough
to attend an annual meeting and a prize distribution
at the Colston Hall. The late Duke,
who presided on the occasion, said it was a
great pleasure to him to be present. He had
witnessed a good deal of the care and discipline
with which the Post Office messengers were looked
after. Like everybody who had a great deal of
correspondence, he had the privilege of having
the services of the best regulated Post Office in
the world. They also had in this country the
privilege of being able to use the best regulated
telegraph service. They might be perfectly sure
that if a man wanted to send a telegram, when once
he put it into the hands of the postal officials,
however ill-written or badly addressed it might be,
it was very probable that the telegram would reach<!--[276.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
its destination. Those who had a good deal of
correspondence were deeply indebted for the splendid
organisation of the Bristol Department. They were
also very much indebted to the telegraph clerks,
who deciphered the scrawls handed them, and who
transmitted the messages. They were deeply
indebted also to the boys for the way in which
they refrained from stopping to play marbles, and
did their duties with great zeal, and delivered their
messages at the proper places and to the proper
persons. They would understand that they were
Government officers, and that they had to discharge
important duties. He could personally say that
those duties were thoroughly well carried out in
the city of Bristol and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Beaufort then distributed the
prizes, after which a telegraph messenger presented
Her Grace with a basket of choice flowers.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Bristol addressed the lads, and
urged them to do their duty thoroughly when on
duty, and to enter heartily into healthy play when
off duty. In doing their duty they should remember
one or two things. They might be charged with
the delivery of a message which was a matter of<!--[277.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
life or death; it might be one regarding which
thousands of pounds depended; or it might be
one of little importance. But, whatever it was,
it was not for them to enquire, but to deliver the
message with punctuality and promptness. Having
spoken of the discipline and training telegraph
boys received, he observed that of all telegraph
boys, for punctuality, steadiness, courtesy, and
politeness, the Bristol boys were about the best.
He urged them also to live pure lives and observe
complete honesty, that they might become worthy
citizens of whom the country might be proud.
He was glad to hear the name of the lady (Miss
Pollock) who conducted the scriptural class so
cordially received, which showed that the lady and
her work had taken hold of the hearts of the boys.
The excellence of their work as boys, and as men,
and the enjoyment of their lives, in the best sense,
depended upon their becoming God-fearing. He
should be pleased to give a prize in connection
with the Scripture class.</p>

<p>The letters of the Bishop, written with reference
to the occasion, should not be left unchronicled.
They ran as follows, viz.:<!--[278.png]-->

pulpit in Badminton Church at the Duke's obsequies,
in juxtaposition with a wreath of mammoth
proportions sent by the officers of the 7th Dragoons
(the Duke's old Regiment).</p>

<p>The Bristol telegraph messengers have cause to
remember that bright Saturday afternoon in 1895
when, preceded by their drum and fife band, they
marched out to Burfield, Westbury-on-Trym, the
country residence of Sir (then Mr.) R. H. Symes,
the Mayor of Bristol. They were there enabled to
have a few hours of recreation and pleasure, and
to forget the busy hum of the city with its turmoil
and heat. Following the excellent example, Mr.
Arthur Baker, of Henbury, and other country
gentlemen have invited the boys out on Saturday
afternoons, to encourage them to keep banded
together for good purposes, and to maintain that
<i>esprit de corps</i> which is so necessary in a body of
youths drawn together after the manner of the
Telegraph Messengers' Class.</p>

<p>A most memorable occasion was that in 1897,<!--[281.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
when the messengers were inspected by Lieutenant-Colonel
MacGregor, of the 24th Middlesex R.V.C.,
London. They mustered at the Post Office, and,
under the direction of Inspectors Mawditt, Appleby
(late 29th Regiment and sergeant-major Scinde
Volunteers), and Cook (late Royal Marines), and
headed by their drum and fife band, marched to
the Artillery Drill Ground in Whiteladies Road
where, in presence of many visitors, military and
civilian, they were put through manual exercises,
physical drill to music, and then reviewed on the
parade ground. In the speeches which followed
the boys were complimented on their efficiency and
smart appearance. It was on this occasion that it
was announced the Postmaster-General had obtained
the sanction of the Treasury for a grant of money
in order to encourage telegraph messengers' institutes
and drill in the large towns. Under this
scheme, prizes for proficiency in drill and general
good conduct are awarded&mdash;a system which has
since been found to work admirably.<!--[282.png]-->

<h5>LETTER DELIVERY SYSTEM.<br /><br />
POSTMEN: THEIR DUTIES AND RECREATIONS.</h5>


<p>The extent of the Bristol postal establishment
in 1775 may be gleaned from the reply given
by the Postmasters-General to a memorial complaining
that there was only one letter carrier for
the delivery of all the letters received in Liverpool.
The answer was that only one letter carrier was
maintained in any provincial town, including the
premier city of Bristol, and that they did not think
themselves justified in incurring for Liverpool the
expense of another. An additional Bristol postman
was, however, appointed between then and January,
1778. In 1792 there were four letter carriers at
Bristol, but only two appear to have been allowed
by the Department, the other two being employed
as extras, and provided for, probably, by an extra
charge on the letters delivered. The Bristol letter
carriers were not supplied with uniform clothing
until 1858. Then, a hat and coat once yearly,<!--[283.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and a waterproof cape once in two years, were
given to them. The uniform clothing was not
supplied to the auxiliary letter carriers. Bags or
pouches for the men to carry for the protection of
the letters were at that time provided.</p>

<p>In 1859 the postmen wore scarlet uniform and
issued out from the Post Office three times daily
to traverse the length and breadth of the city in
the distribution of letters. In 1899 the "men in
blue" sally forth six times every day.</p>

<p>In the postmen's department there are now seven
inspectors and three hundred and seventy postmen.
The delivery of letters in the town district is made
from the head office. There is a branch delivering
office at Clifton, but those at North Street and
Phippen Street were long since abandoned. In
the Bristol postal district, sixty years ago, there
were fewer than 20,000 letters delivered in a week,
or about 1,000,000 in a year&mdash;a number now nearly
reached in a week. The letters delivered annually
from the Central Post Office number 31,000,000;
from the Clifton Post Office, 6,250,000; from the
suburban offices and rural offices, 7,300,000. It
is a noteworthy fact that the letters posted in Bristol<!--[284.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
for delivery within its own limit form 27 per cent.
of the total number, which percentage is only surpassed
at two or three of the large cities of the
Kingdom. Six deliveries of letters and five
deliveries of parcels are made in the city, with
ten collections. The average number of persons
to whom letters are delivered by each postman in
Bristol (city) is 1,800. There are 666,536 parcels
delivered annually. To each of two firms are
delivered more than one quarter of a million
letters annually, equal to one hundredth part of
the total number of letters delivered.</p>

<p>The distances from the head office to the extreme
outward terminal City and Clifton delivery points
are as follows:&mdash;Westbury Park, 2½ miles; Horfield
Barracks, 3 miles; Ridgeway, 2½ miles; Barton
Hill, 1¾ miles; Arno's Vale, 1¾ miles; Totterdown,
2 miles; Bedminster Down, 2 miles; Ashton Gate,
2 miles; and Clifton Suspension Bridge, 1½ miles.
The trams are used by the postmen, and the
Department pays the Tramways Company a lump
sum in respect thereof. The convenience in this
respect will be enhanced when the electric traction
system is fully introduced.<!--[285.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>


<p>In the sorting office the letters are sorted to
the various rounds by postmen dividers, and the
general body of postmen then have to arrange
them at their desks seated on little revolving stools.
The process adopted by the postmen in setting in
their letters for delivery may be explained by the
following example relating to what is technically
known as the "Cotham Brow Walk." The letters
are first primarily divided (upright) into streets,
roads, squares, courts, etc., taken thus&mdash;viz.:
(<i>a</i>) Sydenham Road, 1 to 18 (one side only);
(<i>b</i>) Sydenham Hill, 45 to 11, odd numbers (one
side only); (<i>c</i>) Tamworth Place 13 to 1 (one side
only); (<i>d</i>) Arley Hill, 2 to 34 and 5 to 27 (cross);
(<i>e</i>) Arley Park (cross); (<i>f</i>) Arley Hill, 36 and 38
and 29 to 41 (cross); (<i>g</i>) Cotham Brow, 124 to 88
and 125 to 27 (cross); (<i>h</i>) Southfield Road, 2 to 28
and 1 to 27 (cross); (<i>i</i>) Upper Sydenham Road,
38 to 19 (one side only); (<i>j</i>) Springfield Road, 47
to 85, odd numbers (one side only). Then the
letters for one of the above-named ten divisions or
streets are taken one by one and placed in order of
actual delivery flat on the table; then all are
gathered together and stood upright, the letters for<!--[286.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
each division being treated in like manner. When
the letters for any one street or road, etc., have
been set in order, fresh batches of letters of, say,
thirty or so, are fully sub-divided by the same
process before being set in with the accumulated
and finished letters. This course is necessary in
order to obviate the postman having to go through
a set of fifty or a hundred letters time after time
as he gets a fresh batch of letters. Two hours
are allowed for the morning delivery and one and
a half hours for other deliveries. As those who
have the longest rounds have the lightest burdens,
they all contrive to finish at about the same time.</p>

<p>The Clifton Suspension Bridge, which was erected
in 1864 at a cost of &pound;100,000, plays a very unimportant
part in postal affairs, as it serves for the
passage over the Avon of three postmen only, who
cross with letters for the Leigh Woods and Failand
districts. Long Ashton, which has a carriage road
approached by the bridge from the Clifton side,
receives its letters by a postman who crosses by a
ferry lower down the river and reaches his destination
more expeditiously than by crossing over the
bridge.<!--[287.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>


<p>A Bristol postman, who was well acquainted with
the locality which he had to serve, met with an
ugly accident through colliding with a lamp-post,
recently erected and not supplied with gas for
lighting up. It had been put up during the
man's interval of duty, so that he came upon it for
the first time when it was shrouded in darkness.
The postmen, having in the discharge of their duties
to be early birds and to be first out and about in the
morning, often pick up articles lost or deposited
overnight. Thus it was that a postman found on
one winter's morn in a Bristol suburb a parcel containing
the dead body of a child, and had to constitute
himself a corpse-carrier for the nonce. It was in this
city of Bristol that the following somewhat amusing
and certainly interesting incident took place. Two
rats were found in combat over a letter, which, delivered
in due course by the postman, had fallen upon
the floor at the entrance to a warehouse, and had been
dragged thence to the spot where the rodents were
engaged in their fierce encounter, the gum on the
flap probably being the attraction. The letter
contained a cheque for &pound;300, and its loss for some
days caused no small amount of consternation and<!--[288.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
anxiety to the gentleman who should have received
it, and who, it need scarcely be said, at once gave
orders for a letter-box to be attached to his warehouse
door.</p>

<p>It was well for the Magistrates' Clerk for
the Gloucestershire Division of Bristol that he was
well known to the postman, or assuredly he would
never have received the letter addressed thus: "Mr.
Latchem Laforegat pleace stashun," the proper
address being: "Mr. Latcham, Lawford's Gate
Police Station, Stapleton Road, Bristol."</p>

<p>Recently many valuable dogs were poisoned in
different parts of the city, and a suggestion
appeared in the newspapers that the postmen
might be urged to constitute themselves amateur
detectives for the discovery of the miscreants, on
the ground that they enter every garden and knock
at every door throughout the length and breadth
of Bristol, and that at early morn and late at
night as well as by day. The postmen are public
spirited, but it is hardly likely that they would go
considerably out of their way for the purpose, considering
the risks which they run from dogs and the
annoyances to which they are subjected to by<!--[289.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
them. The postmen have to face the snappish
terrier and the ferocious-looking bulldog. Not
infrequently they get bitten, and more frequently
get soundly abused if, for their own protection,
they belabour a dog occasionally, or give it a taste
of their belt for want of a better weapon of
defence or offence. Reciprocity would demand
that if the postmen look out for dog poisoners,
the owners of dogs on their part should take the
utmost care to keep their dogs properly secured
when known to be dangerous or to have a
special dislike to the public servants in blue.
The bold announcement given on the pillar of a
gateway of a residence in a fashionable suburb
of Bristol, "Beware of the bulldog," is not calculated
to give confidence to the postmen who have to
deliver the letters. One poor dog, well known in
the city, fell dead in Small Street; and as the dog
had just been seen to visit the Post Office, and
even to drink from a Bristol Dogs' Home trough
standing in the portico, it was assumed by the
many spectators of the poodle's sad death that he
had come to an untimely end through drinking
poisoned water from the Post Office trough. The<!--[290.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
vessel was therefore confiscated by an over-zealous
supporter of the Dogs' Home, and the water was
subjected to analysis, but investigation proved that
it was innocuous, although from an examination
it transpired that the dog really had died from
poison, which had, however, been taken in meat.</p>

<p>A London firm made indignant enquiry as to why
a letter had been returned to them through the
Returned Letter Office, seeing that it was addressed
to a well-known and distinguished baronet living
near Bristol. It turned out that the right hon.
gentleman was himself the cause of the return of
the letter, as he read the contracted words "Rt.
Honb.," in a line preceding his own name, as the
name of "Robt. Hunt," a person who lived near
his mansion, and he gave the letter back to the
postman with the foregoing result. In 1847 a letter
indicative of the times, with the following superscription,
as noticed in the post:&mdash;"To the Post
Office, Bristol, Somersetshire, England, 115 miles west
of London, this letter is to be delivered to the Ladey
that transported Jobe Smith and 2 others with him
near Bristol." Members of the public complain
from time to time in indignant terms respecting<!--[291.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the loss of letters in the post, but in very many
instances they afterwards write in meeker strain
to say they have discovered the missing letters&mdash;in
most unlikely places in their homes.</p>

<p>At a dinner given by officials of the Bristol Post
Office, the Dean of Bristol bestowed praise on the
postmen for success in conveying ill-addressed
letters to their destination. Dr. Pigou cited their
performances in his own case. He had been
addressed as Pigue, Picken, Pigon, Pigour,
Pickles, Peggue, Puegon, Ragou, and Pagan.
That "Ragou"&mdash;not being a name beginning
with "P"&mdash;should have reached him, he thought
could only be explained as the result either of a
flash of inspiration or of the recollection of previous
"hashes" of his name; but "Pickles" evidently
got home on the mere strength of its initial letter,
and though, as he complained, it is hard lines to be
addressed as "Dr. Pagan" after having been thirty
or forty years in orders, the written word would
much more nearly resemble his real name than
several of the other addresses which did find him.
"The Head Gamekeeper, the Deanery, Bristol,"
was, of course, mysterious. The letter contained<!--[292.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
a circular advertising wire netting for pheasants,
rabbits, and hares; and when the Dean replied,
pointing out that the only space available on his
premises&mdash;an area of 30 ft. by 40 ft.&mdash;was too
small to rear pheasants in, he received, a further
circular recommending a trial of "our dog biscuits."
Occasionally, also, the local postmen meet with
letters so peculiarly addressed as that for "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, Oction
her and Countent, Corn Street, Bristol," and
another for "Chowl, near Temple," intended for
"Cholwell, near Temple Cloud." The postmen
collect, too, letters peculiarly addressed to other
places.</p>

<p>There are still a few postmen veterans in the
Bristol Post Office who are toiling on long after
having exceeded their "three score years." Doubtless
these aged men excite sympathy as they are
seen on their daily rounds, and the thought
presents itself to the public mind that the Post
Office is harsh to make them labour when so
far advanced in years. Such is not the case,
however, as the men, unfortunately not being
entitled to pensions, have been allowed to continue
to perform their duties long after pensionable<!--[293.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
established men would have been retired, either
willingly or compulsorily, under the regulations
which now call for a Civil servant's retirement
to be considered his reaching the age of sixty
years. These old worthies are not Post Office
short-service men; but, as their good conduct
stripes testify, they have for long years served
their Queen and country.</p>

<p>J. S., one of these life-long toilers, who
worked as an uncovenanted postman for many
years, commenced his career in the navy. When
fifteen years of age (1844) he joined the gunnery
ship <i>Excellent</i> at Portsmouth, Captain (afterwards
Admiral) Chade being then in command. After
serving two years, he was transferred to the old
<i>Conway</i>, then engaged in putting down the slave trade
in East African waters; and after three years on board
that vessel he went to the brig <i>Helena</i>, and was with
her in the West Indies for several years. In about
1854 he was passed to the <i>Britannia</i> for Mediterranean
service. While sailing from Gibraltar to
Malta, S. met with a serious accident. Being considered
a smart young man, he was ordered by
the captain to assist another "A.B." to rig the<!--[294.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
topgallant yard-arm. While thus at work he fell
from the maintopmast cross-trees into the main
rigging, again to the main chains, and then
overboard&mdash;a drop in all of 120 feet. A boat
was lowered promptly, and he was soon picked
up, but he was in an insensible condition. It was
found on examination by the ship's surgeon that
his skull was fractured. He went into hospital
on arrival at Malta, and there he remained six
months. Shortly after the accident, the <i>Britannia</i>,
which was the Admiral's flagship, was ordered to
the Crimea (1855), and not only did the seaman who
took over S.'s gun meet with his death by the
shells from the fortifications at Sebastopol, but the
whole of the gallant tars fighting on the starboard
side of the ship were killed. S. was taken to
London on board the <i>Growler</i> (Sir Charles Wood),
the first steamer he had ever seen, and was
incapacitated for two or three years, but fortunately
he obtained a pension on having to leave the navy.
He was engaged in private life till 1878, when, at
the age of 49 years, he was given Post Office work,
on which he was employed for twenty years, and,
indeed, until he again came to grief through an<!--[295.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
accident when on duty at Christmas, 1898. On
this occasion he was knocked over by a cart in
Victoria Street, which ran into the parcel handcart
S. was wheeling, and which sent him flying
into the mud and his parcels all about in the
road. This put an end to his Post Office career,
and the old man, with disabled body from his first
accident and somewhat impaired faculty from the
latter, has now sunk back into seclusion, and it is
hoped that he may end his days in peace. Except
for three weeks' illness caused by influenza, he was
never away on sick leave out of his twenty years of
Post Office service. Not once was S. late at work.
He was, he says, always out of bed at 3 a.m.,
and so punctual was he known to be that the remark
was often made when he entered the office, that
"We know what time it is without looking at the
clock." On leaving the Post Office service this year
(1899) a small gratuity was awarded him.</p>

<p>S. T., although in his 71st year, managed up till
quite recently to perform Post Office work for a few
hours daily. From early boyhood up to his 22nd
year, T. was engaged at shoemaking in this city;
then he enlisted and served as gunner and driver in<!--[296.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the Royal Horse Artillery for three years. Having
obtained his discharge from the army, he acted as
policeman on the Great Western Railway for a
few months. At the time of the Crimean War,
T. again enlisted, this time as a seaman and
gunner in Her Majesty's Navy. He was disabled
in action and discharged with a life pension. For
the next twenty-seven years he followed his former
occupation of shoemaking and rounding, working
for about twenty years for one firm in this city.
When 53 years of age, he first obtained employment
in the Post Office, working for a few hours daily,
and receiving 10s. per-week. He is a member of
the Crimean and Indian Veterans' Association.</p>

<p>A Bristol Post Office benefit society was established
in March, 1861. It became the Bristol
Letter Carriers' Sick Benefit Society in 1862, and
was carried on under that title up to 1890 when
it ceased.</p>

<p>Early in the year of 1896, the remains of the
late Thomas Rutley, one of the oldest of Bristol
postmen, were interred at Greenbank Cemetery.
About one hundred postmen, headed by the Post
Office band, were in attendance to mark their<!--[297.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
sympathy, and respect to his memory. The Rev.
Moffat Logan conducted the service. Such a mark
of respect is not always accorded to deceased
Post Office servants. The writer recollects on a
bright summer day having attended the funeral at
Highgate Cemetery of one of the oldest and most
respected superintendents in the Post Office, London.
The good man was so much liked by those who
served under him that he had gained for himself
the name of "Honest John," yet there was only
one other official besides the writer to stand by
his graveside.</p>

<p>The postmen have a military band, composed of
thirty members of their own staff. The primary
object is to advance the art of music in the Post
Office, and, secondarily, to provide concerts in the
open spaces in Bristol for the benefit of the public.
A grand concert is given by the band every year,
which is usually attended by some 3,000 of the
inhabitants, attracted chiefly by the popularity of
the Post Office and by the fame of artistes so eminent
as Madame Ella Russell, Madame Fanny Moody,
Mr. Plunkett Greene, and others, who have from
time to time been engaged.<!--[298.png]-->

<p>The "D" Company of the 1st Volunteer Battalion
Gloucester Regiment is composed almost exclusively
of members of the Bristol Post Office. For three
years in succession, (1894-5-6), this company won
the first prize in the drill competition and also first
prize and challenge vase in the volley firing competition.
The company challenge bowl and first
prize, and the brigadier's cup and third prize
in the Western District of England, were also won
by the company during the same period. For many
years the Bristol Post Office has had two out of
the nine representatives of the battalion competing
for the Queen's Prize. The company has also been
well represented in all the battalion and county
shooting matches. Of the eight battalion signallers,
five are Post Office men, who have on several occasions
held first place in the Volunteer service annual
examinations.</p>

given a Ten Guinea Challenge Cup, to be raced for
by Bristol postmen who use bicycles in connection
with their Post Office business of delivering and
collecting letters. The cup has to be won three
years, not necessarily in succession, before it
becomes the postman's sole property. The terms
under which the competition for the cup is held are
as follows, viz.:&mdash;"Competitors to be postmen of
any age or rank; appointed, unestablished,
auxiliary, or sub-postmaster's assistant, of not less
than two years' service, who have never won a
prize in public competition. Competitors to be
certified as having in the course of the preceding
twelve months, under official sanction or direction,
ridden 150 miles in the execution of their official
duties, or to and from the office when attending
duty. The race to be a handicap race of two
miles, to take place on the Gloucestershire County
Ground or other enclosure during each year.
The post-master, assisted by experts in the Post
Office service, to be the handicapper. The handicap
to be framed on points of age, physical ability,
and regard to be had to the weight or kind of
bicycle to be used in competition." Postman<!--[300.png]-->

Newman, of Coalpit Heath, was the winner this
year (1899).</p>

<p>The postmen have a library, consisting now of
some 700 volumes. It was started in 1892. The
writer made an appeal through the local press for
gifts of books to form the nucleus of a library
for the postmen and telegraph messengers attached
to the Bristol Post Office. This appeal was liberally
and promptly responded to by the residents of
Bristol and Clifton. Warmest thanks are due to
the newspaper proprietors for their kindness in
inserting paragraphs relating to the subject, as,
but for their powerful co-operation in the matter,
the movement could not have been brought to a
successful issue. A well-known literary gentleman
at Clifton gave eighty volumes, Mr. Harold Lewis,
B.A., showed his interest in the movement by the
donation of 200 copies; and Mr. J. W. Arrowsmith
has frequently given fifty volumes at a time. The
postmen themselves manage the library, and contribute
small sums weekly towards its maintenance
and further development.<!--[301.png]-->

<h5>POST LETTER BOXES: POSITION, VIOLATION,
PECULIAR USES.</h5>


<p>The three hundred and fifty pillar and wall
letter boxes are placed at convenient points,
regard being had to the wants of the immediate
neighbourhood that each has to serve&mdash;to approach
by paved crossings, to contiguity to a public lamp,
to being out of the way of pedestrians and as far
removed from mud-splashing as possible. At the
same time, the inspectors endeavour to place the
boxes so that they may be an attraction, rather
than an eyesore, to the spot where erected.</p>

<p>The sign of "The Pillar Box" has been given
to a public-house before which a Post Office
box stands. Occasionally the Post Office letter
boxes are greatly misused. Some little time since
a woman in Bristol was savage enough to drop
oil of vitriol, nitric acid, and other dangerous
fluids into the boxes. She even poured paraffin
into the letter box at a post office, and dropped an<!--[302.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
ignited match in after it. A conflagration was only
averted by the fortunate circumstance of the postman
clearing the box just in time to extinguish the
commencing fire. The woman's determination is
evidenced from the fact that her hands were severely
burned by the strong acid she used; but, notwithstanding
this, she continued night after night to
carry on her dastardly work. She was found out
after much anxious watching, and having, on trial,
been found guilty, she was sentenced by a lenient
judge to six months' imprisonment. She would assign
no reason for her incomprehensible behaviour even
when asked by the judge in court. Not infrequently,
mischievous children place lighted matches, rubbish,
etc., in the Post Office letter boxes, and in the letter
boxes of private houses and warehouses. The Post
Office officials are always on the alert to discover the
delinquents. It is desirable also that the public,
in their own interests, should call the attention of
postmen and the police at once to any case in which
they may observe letter boxes being tampered with.
It may not be generally known that offences of this
kind are punishable by imprisonment under the
Post Office Protection Act.<!--[303.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>


<p>A remarkable case was that of a servant who
was a somnambulist, and who for some time wrote
letters in her sleep, night after night, and took
them to adjacent letter boxes to post. Sometimes
she was fully attired, and at other times only
partially so. As a rule, the letters were properly
addressed, but the girl did not always place postage
stamps upon them.</p>

<p>Occasionally the postmen have to encounter the
difficulties arising from a frost-bound letter box.
Such a case occurred with a box situated on the
summit of the Mendip Hills. The letter box and
the wall in which the box is built were found by
the postman to be covered with ice, caused by rain
and snow having frozen on them. The door resisted
all his efforts to open it, and he had to leave it for
the night. On making another effort when morning
came, it taxed his ingenuity and that of other
interested and willing helpers to get the box
open. Hot water was tried, paraffin was poured
into the lock, and it was only after a hammer had
been used and a fire in a movable grate had been
applied for a time that the lid could be opened.</p>

<p>A letter box erected in a brick pillar in a secluded<!--[304.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
spot on the East Harptree road, about a mile
distant from any habitation, was, late one night,
damaged to the extent of having its iron door
completely smashed off, apparently either by means
of a large stone which lay at its base when the
violation was discovered, or by means of a hammer
and jemmy. Although the adjacent ground, ditches,
and hedges were searched, no trace of the iron door
could be found. As three roysterers were known
to have passed the box on the night in question,
it was assumed that the damage was done by them
out of pure mischief and not from any desire to
rob Her Majesty's mails. Whether such were the
case or not, they had the unpleasant experience of
being locked up over the Sunday on suspicion.<!--[305.png]-->

<h5>RURAL DISTRICT SUB-POSTMASTERS.<br />
RURAL POSTMEN. INCIDENTS.</h5>


<p>The Bristol postal area is an extensive one, the
distance from point to point being thirty miles,
with width ranging from five to twelve miles. It is
bounded on one side by the river Severn, from a
point about five miles below Sharpness to a point
close to Portishead; thence the boundary stretches
across country to the Mendip Hills, up to Cheddar
Cliffs; then from a point four miles north-east of
Wells to Newton-St.-Loe, near Bath; across the
river Avon, under Lansdown, thence in a line by
Pucklechurch, Iron Acton, and Thornbury across to
the starting-point on the Severn. The large rural
area is for the greater part agricultural in character,
but there are collieries and stone quarries in some
few districts.</p>

<p>At the Bristol town and rural sub-Post Offices
there are 554 assistants of all kinds employed.<!--[306.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Many rural sub-postmasters act as postmen; in the
main it is a healthy occupation, and proves a very
good antidote to sedentary employment, although
there are hardships to be borne, as the toil has to be
undergone in all weathers&mdash;the scorching sun of
summer, the pitiless cold of winter&mdash;in rain, hail,
and snow. In connection With the Early Closing
Movement, at some of the outer Post Offices business
is suspended at 5.0 on one day in the week&mdash;usually
Wednesday.</p>

<p>In the suburban and rural districts there are 105
sub-Post Offices, and 78 of them are letter delivery
offices, served by an aggregate number of 226 postmen.
Of the 78 districts, 42 have two daily deliveries
28 three, and 6 four, with about a corresponding
number of collections.</p>

<p>The sorting clerks and telegraphists at head-quarters
gain some sort of acquaintance with
sub-postmasters through daily communication by
mail bag and wire; also in the passage of reports
and counter-reports; but occasionally people performing
postal work throughout the extensive
Bristol district are brought into closer harmony
and touch with each other by means of social<!--[307.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
functions, such as "outings" and Bristol Channel
steamer trips, when town and country officials
take their pastime in company, and the sub-postmasters
and sub-postmistresses of the Somersetshire
portion of the district get acquainted with those
of the Gloucestershire side, and all with the head
office officials. By these means of friendly intercourse
and interchange of kindly feeling, the
service is much benefited. As an indication of
this exchange of courtesy, the felicitations exchanged
by telegram when the first annual trip by steamer
to Ilfracombe was taken ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From Postmaster, Bristol.&mdash;Pleasant journey
to you. Long may Sub-Postmasterly friendship
continue."</p>

<p>"From Sub-Postmasters at Ilfracombe.&mdash;Telegram
received. Thanks for good wishes. Have
just drank your good health. Pleasant trip.
Regret your absence extremely.&mdash;Sub-Postmasters."</p>

<p>The Bristol Post Office has only recently had
electric light introduced, but the squire of East
Harptree had long before set the good example
of progress by having the Post Office in his village
illuminated by electricity. In the Bristol area very<!--[308.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
many villages have their little counterpart of the
huge combination shops in London, where the
villager is enabled to procure everything that his
modest income will allow him to purchase. It is
at these village "Whiteleys" that the Post Office
is generally to be found, and a surveying officer
may soon become well versed in the qualities of
bacon, cheese, bread, flour, candles, and get a
knowledge of rakes, prongs, and besoms, without
much difficulty. In other instances no business
except that of Post Office work is carried on.</p>

<p>The picture of the sub-Post Office at Cribbs
Causeway, five miles from Bristol, may give our
readers who are "in cities pent" an idea of a
delightful place for the sale of postage stamps
and postal orders and the distribution of letters.
This unique Post Office has few houses anywhere
near it, but it serves a large, albeit very sparsely
populated, area. Some of its interest rests in the
fact that it was formerly the half-way inn on the
once important highway from Bristol to New
Passage, for the ferry over the Severn into South
Wales. Some of our elderly readers may probably
recollect it as the stopping stage of the coaches which<!--[309.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
ran prior to the introduction of the railway system.
The sub-Post Office, which stands on high ground,
is held by two sisters, who went to it as a health
resort from a farm in the low-lying Severn marsh.
They act as postwomen, and brisk exercise and the
early morning dew has brought such roses to their
cheeks as would be envied by their Post Office
sisters whose fate it is to reside in smoke-begrimed
regions.</p>

<p>Although some of the Bristol district villages are
situated at a long distance from town and remote
from main roads, yet only one of the Post Offices
presents the primitive condition of having a thatched
roof. None of the rural postmen now avail themselves
on their journeys of the services of that
faithful creature, the donkey; but the last animal
so used was on the road until 1890, when its master,
poor Sims, the Congresbury to Shipham postman,
shuffled off this mortal coil. Times change, and our
manners change with them; so also do our tests
for gold coins. At the Wrington Post Office there
are brass testing weights, for sovereigns and half-sovereigns,
inscribed "Royal Mint, 1843," such as
have not been observed by the writer at any other
Post Office, either in the Bristol district or in
London. A certain sub-postmistress in the district
has for many years been in the habit of keeping
her sheets of reserve postage stamps in a large
Family Bible. Not that she is irreverent&mdash;indeed,
she is a pious woman,&mdash;but, being a lone widow,
she has kept them in that manner for safety, as
she imagines that no burglar would look for them
in such a depository.<!--[311.png]-->

<p>A notable man in his day was Edward Biddle,
on the Thornbury side of Bristol. Mr. Biddle was
sub-postmaster of Rudgeway for over forty years,
and occupied the post until his death in 1889, at
the ripe age
of 91 years,
when he was
succeeded by
his daughter,
and she, in
turn, was succeeded
by his
son, William
Biddle, who
still holds the
appointment.
Prior to becoming
sub-postmaster,
Mr. Edward
Biddle was
"Pike" keeper
at Stone, and used to pay &pound;752 per annum
for his post. There he had to open his gate<!--[312.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to no fewer than twenty mail coaches daily,
on their way between Bristol and Gloucester.
At Rudgeway he carried on the joint occupation
of sub-postmaster and innkeeper, at a tavern
where the Post Office business had been conducted
for many years before he succeeded to it; but
the innkeeping business had in course of time
to be given up, under Post Office regulations.
Mr. Elstone, of Alveston House, wrote expressing
his satisfaction that the Post Office was to be carried
on at a private house, and not as previously at a
"roadside pothouse," which all the district considered
a very improper place. At that time
John Blann and other stage carriers drove their
unwieldy waggons, drawn by four strong cart-horses
at a walking pace, along the Gloucester
turnpike road. The waggons were indeed the
goods trains of olden times. The present sub-postmaster,
the son of Edward Biddle, who has
had for many years to use "Shanks's" pony in
the delivery of letters, was engaged in olden
times in going on horseback down to the Passage
to take, in saddlebags, the mails for South Wales
and receive them therefrom. As late as 1850,<!--[313.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
letters from Rudgeway for Bristol were impressed
with a stamp thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class='Title'>
BRISTOL<br />
4 JA 50.<br />
BY POST.<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. James Tiley, the village blacksmith of
Clutton, now an octogenarian, calls to mind that
sixty years ago the letters for Clutton, Temple
Cloud, Stowey, Bishop Sutton and adjacent districts
were delivered from Old Down, a hamlet on the
main coach road from Bath to Wells, distant from
Tyburn Turnpike, London, 121 miles. Mr. Tiley
has had the luxury of paying 10d. for a letter
brought from London by the above means; and as it
was dear to him at the time, it is dear to him now in
another sense as a reminiscence of the past. Mr.
Tiley recalls the sending of letters of the district by
waggoners to Bristol or Bath to save the postage,
and slyly remarks: "So stupid were the waggoners
that as often as not they brought the letters back
again, having forgotten to&mdash;what Post Office people
now term&mdash;'properly dispose of them.'" Also that
Joseph Tippett, a postman of the olden time, was
brutally assaulted on Stowey Hill, and nearly lost<!--[314.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
his life and his letters. His assailants were discovered
and were transported for life. The Old
Down postman was timed to reach Temple Cloud
Bridge at 12.0, and always blew horn or whistle to
let the village schoolmaster know the time of day.
During the Bristol riots the arrival of the mail
every morning was eagerly awaited by persons far
and near, anxious to hear the latest news.</p>

<p>So recently as the year 1867, a postman had to
trudge right away from Bristol to the distant village
of Chew Stoke, having to breast the steep hill of
Dundry and pass through Chew Magna on his way.
All the letters and newspapers then delivered at
Bishopsworth, Dundry, Chew Magna and Chew
Stoke were carried by this man. Now, with the
introduction of the parcel post and a cheaper letter
post, and consequently increased weight, the morning
mail is carried in a mail cart, and that service
is supplemented by two or three other despatches to
Chew Magna and Chew Stoke by train <i>vi&acirc;</i> Pensford.
The hamlets of Breach Hill, Moreton and Herons
Green were at that time unserved by the postman
officially, and if delivered privately by him he
charged for them at the rate of an extra penny each.<!--[315.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
The residents in those outlying districts who did
not get their letters delivered in that way, and
who did not call for them at the Chew Stoke Post
Office, usually obtained them&mdash;two, three, or four
days old&mdash;from the postman on Sundays, who
stationed himself at the church door to oblige such
worshippers. Some of the older country postmen
say that in by-gone days the poor people, unable to
read themselves, considered it part of a postman's
duty to read their letters for them, and they looked
for sympathy from the postmen in case of receipt of
bad news. The Chew Stoke postman had a walk,
in and out, of over twenty miles, and had to carry
whatever load there was for the route. The pay
attached to the post was small. This was in the
good (?) days of not so long ago, but the postman
who then had to take the journey is by no means
anxious for a return to them, for now he receives
double the amount of pay then allowed. He was
out from five o'clock in the morning till seven or
eight o'clock at night; but now he performs his
eight hours' duty straight off, and has, therefore,
more time at home for his private purposes.</p>

<p>When, about eight years since, there was a<!--[316.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
deep fall of snow in this district, the West Town
postman, who is likewise sub-postmaster, very
considerably added to his labours by carrying tea,
sugar, medicine, and even bread to the people on
the Mendips, who were snowed up and deserted by
baker, butcher, grocer, and indeed by everyone
except the faithful Queen's messenger. The floods
of November, 1894, which proved very disastrous
in the West of England, interfered in no small
degree with Post Office arrangements in the rural
districts around Bristol. In some villages the
roads were submerged from three to four feet,
and it was impossible for the public to get to the
letter boxes, the postmen and postwomen being,
perhaps, the greatest sufferers. In order to avoid
flooded roads, it was necessary to change routes and
make long detours. Many postmen were compelled
to wade through the water waist deep, whilst others
had to be driven through in horse and cart. The
inhabitants and farmers in many places kindly
lent their horses and carts for the purpose, and
but for these kindnesses the letters would have
been delayed for many hours. In spite of all
difficulties, the letters were generally delivered<!--[317.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
without much delay, and only in a few cases had
the letters to be held over for any length of time
until the waters had subsided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/i317.jpg" width="440" height="358" alt="Letter Box at Winterbourne." title="Letter Box at Winterbourne." />
<span class="caption">Letter Box at Winterbourne.</span>
</div>

<p>A tit made her nest in the bottom of a Post
Office letter box at Winterbourne, near Bristol, laid
her eggs, and notwithstanding that letters were
posted in the box and that the box was cleared by
the postman everyday, the bird tenaciously held to
her nest and brought up five young tits, two of
which perished in their attempts to get out of the
box by means of the small posting aperture through<!--[318.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
which their mother had squeezed so frequently,
carrying with her all the materials for the nest.
The three survivors flew off one day when the door
of the box was purposely left open for a time by
the obliging postman portrayed in the picture.</p>

<p>That all is not gold that glitters has been recently
brought home to three or four of the sub-postmasters
in the Bristol district, a "sharper" having presented
coins gilded to represent sovereigns and half-sovereigns,
and obtained Postal Orders in exchange
for them. Through the vigilance of the Bristol
police the offender was eventually taken into
custody, and, having been sentenced at the Assizes
to six months' imprisonment, he had plenty of
time to reflect on his offences. A bright,
shining new farthing was received at the Bristol
head office, sent inadvertently in a remittance from
a sub-office as a half-sovereign, and mixed up with
coins of that value, only to be detected, however,
by the vigilant check clerk. The sub-postmaster
who accepted it in error for a coin of more precious
metal, and did not discover the mistake even in
preparing the remittance, had to bear the loss.</p>

<p>One sub-postmaster, who has now departed this<!--[319.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
life, was wont to furnish his explanations and
reports in rhyme, a course which was tolerated
on account of its singularity and of the writer's
zeal and known devotion to his duty. The

<p>The turnpike gates in the neighbourhood of
Bristol were abolished in October, 1867, and the
consequence was that the proprietors of the various
omnibuses by which day mail bags were conveyed
to and from several of the districts around Bristol
applied for, and obtained, a money payment in lieu
of the tolls, the exemption, from which had formed
the sole remuneration for the services performed.</p>

<p>The Bristol mail carts running to the rural
districts, by permission of the Post Office, carry
for the newspaper proprietors bundles of papers,
weighing on an average on ordinary days 40 lbs.,
and on Saturdays 80 lbs. The enterprise of the
Bristol newspaper proprietors in circulating by<!--[321.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
private means the many thousands of the newspapers
which they daily print is evidenced, from
the circumstance that they find it necessary to
commit to the agency of the Post Office only about
160 copies for distribution, and that chiefly in
remote rural districts.</p>

<p>Sub-postmasters in the rural districts of Bristol
attain to great ages. The sub-postmaster of
Mangotsfield, who had long since passed three-score
years and ten, had his cross to bear, having
at 60 entirely lost his eyesight. Although blind,
and unable to work in consequence, he quaintly
appeared in his apron to the end, and said that
having worn it for so many years he did not feel
happy without it. A daughter acted as his deputy,
and mitigated, as far as possible, his hard lot. At
his funeral some hundreds of people, representing
various religious and other bodies, attended to pay
their last tribute of respect to him.</p>

<p>At Bitton, a village midway between Bristol and
Bath, there died Sub-postmaster James Brewer, in
the 87th year of his age, and in the fifty-seventh
year of his Post Office service. It was more
pleasant to enter this Post Office and find the old<!--[322.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
man calmly smoking his churchwarden pipe before
the fire, cheery and chatty, than to have such a
welcome as that afforded at another office by the
exhibition on the Post Office counter of a miniature
coffin and artificial wreaths for graves. Another
worthy of local Post Office fame has lately
passed away in the person of Join Warburton,
aged 84, who for thirty years was the sub-postmaster
of Henbury, and who for five years
was his daughter's adviser after her succession to
the appointment. The sub-postmaster of the village
of High Littleton lost an arm some fifty years ago,
but notwithstanding that affliction he manages with
adroitness to sell postage stamps and issue postal
orders to the public. This will not be considered a
very great feat, considering that he has been for
years a crack one-handed shot, and even now, at
the age of 70, can bowl over a pheasant or a rabbit
quite as readily as many of our sportsmen who have
the use of both arms.</p>

<p>Sub-postmistresses of great longevity are also to
be found. One dame (Martha Pike), now in her
93rd year, represented the Department until quite
recently in the charming little village of Wraxall.<!--[323.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
When nearly 90 years old she had a three hour
letter round every morning up hill and down dale,
and she even trudged a mile and a half to fetch a
letter and parcel mail from the railway station.
The sub-postmistress of Stoke Bishop died at the
age of 84; she and her father had held the Post
Office in the village for over fifty years. An equally
remarkable case was that of Hannah Vowles, the sub-postmistress
of Frenchay, who, after performing the
active duties of that position in the village of Frenchay
for forty-seven years, resigned when within five
years of 100 years old. In her youth she lived for
some time in the West Indies; but she gave up her
employment there in order to return home to support
her mother, who was 90 years of age when she died.
Mrs. Hannah was succeeded in the office of sub-postmistress
by Miss Kate Vowdes, a relation, who
had already been postwoman in the same district
forty-two years!</p>

<span class="caption">Hannah Brewer.</span><br /><i>(Postwoman.)</i>
</div>

<p>Hannah Brewer is one of the Bristol Post Office
worthies. Her father was the sub-postmaster of the
village of Bitton alluded to herein. Hannah commenced
to deliver letters in the hamlets and at the
farmhouses near Bitton when a mere child, and<!--[324.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
continued to do so during all the years our gracious
Sovereign has sat on the throne. Recently, however,
she had to give up the work, as, having
attained the advanced age of 72 years and walked<!--[325.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
her quarter of a million of miles, she felt that she
ought to take life more easily than hitherto. In
distance her round was eleven miles daily, and
the route was a very trying one on account of
the steep hills she had to traverse, and of great
exposure to the sun in summer, and to the wind,
frost, and snow in winter. It may be interesting
to record that Hannah Brewer, although she
had to serve a district sparsely populated, was
never robbed, stopped, nor molested in any way.
She was the recipient of the first official waterproof
clothing issued to postwomen in England, and
in her picture she is represented as wearing it.
She only occasionally made visits even to places
so near as Bath or Bristol, and was, as a rule,
a stay at home.</p>

<p>She was not a great reader of the newspapers,
but persons on her round looked to her as an
oracle, and derived information from her as to
passing events. Hannah naively says that, as
regards Christmas boxes, she fared very well in
olden times, but they were not so plentiful in her
later years. Hannah, through her devotion to
her father when he was alive, and through her<!--[326.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
assiduous attention to her duties as a humble
servant of the Crown, had gained the respect of
all those who knew her, both in her native village
and on the long round she daily had to traverse.
As she served the Post Office throughout her long
life (her memory carrying her back to the days
when the letters reached Bitton by mail coach and
a "single" letter from London cost 10d.), it is
gratifying that in her old age, when unable to
continue to do her daily round, the Lords of
the Treasury, under her exceptional circumstances,
granted her half-pay pension, a sum which, with
her savings, will serve to maintain her until the
end of her days. The writer has had few more
pleasurable duties than that which he undertook
of presenting Hannah, in her neat and trim
cottage, with her first pension warrant.</p>

<p>At the celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee
in the village, the opportunity was taken, in the
midst of the festivities, to make a presentation of
an elegant marble clock and purse to Miss Brewer.
The inscription ran: "Presented during Her
Majesty's Diamond Jubilee, together with a
purse of money, by the inhabitants of the postal<!--[327.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
district of Bitton, Gloucestershire, to Miss Hannah
Brewer, postwoman, upon her retirement, having
served this office from the commencement of
Queen Victoria's reign."</p>

<p>Even Post Office surveyors are sometimes the
subject of little jokes on the part of their subordinates.
An assistant surveyor, when testing a
rural postman's walk, said that if he had arranged
the round originally, he should have taken a shortcut
across the fields to a certain little hamlet so
as to serve it before instead of after a more distant
place, when the postman drily said that he should
not have done anything of the kind, as there was a
rhine about 18 ft. wide and very deep, which could
not well be got over or through, and, turning to
the surveyor, he remarked: "Evidently you never
were a postman." The humour of this incident
lies in the fact that the surveyors have always
been drawn from the &eacute;lite of the Service. A
certain imperious surveyor visited a sub-office for
the purpose of reprimanding the sub-postmaster
for some delinquency, and after soundly rating the
individual he addressed, and refusing to hear a single
word in explanation, he, when his harangue was<!--[328.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
over, was coolly informed that he had made a slight
mistake, as the circumstance referred to another
sub-office altogether.</p>

<p>On a certain occasion recently, on entering a
Post Office the writer heard proceeding from a
back room a voice, recognisable as that of the
sub-postmaster, shouting out a greeting in his
(the writer's) Christian name: "Come in, Robert."
Well, the sub-postmaster thought he saw through
the partly-curtained glass in the door a friend of
that name, and meant no disrespect to his surveyor-postmaster.</p>

<p>On calling at another little Post Office on a
Saturday, the aged sub-postmistress was washing
her stone floor&mdash;down on her knees in business-like
attitude. Without looking up, her greeting to
the writer was: "Halloa! I thought you had
been to Jericho. You have not been to see
me for such a long time!" That salutation
was rather embarrassing; but on getting to the
perpendicular the old lady was the confused party,
as she had thought her visitor was a local resident
who occasionally looked in to have a cheery word
with her.<!--[329.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>


<p>It would seem that postal improvements in the
Bristol district have been carried almost as far as
is needful; indeed, in one district, not seven miles
from the city, contemplated improvements whereby
letters would be delivered an hour earlier in the
morning and might be posted two hours later at
night, and a day mail in and out be afforded, were
declined by the parish authorities in council and by
memorial from the villagers generally. In this
rural hollow the people are very clannish, and
rather than let their postwoman suffer a loss of
two shillings a week, which the change involved,
they were content to forego improved postal
facilities, and were not greatly stirred by the
"lasinesse of posts" as, according to history, was
King James of old.</p>

<p>While Bristol is ever expanding and while
splendid buildings are being erected, there are
not wanting places within a short distance of the
ancient city where there are signs of decadence,
as indicated by houses unoccupied and cottages
in ruins, and by shrinkage in the number of
letters. At Stanton Drew, where some thirty large
stones alone remain to mark a site where there<!--[330.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
probably stood a splendid Druidical Temple, the
postal arrangements a few years since were not in a
satisfactory condition. Not unlike the story which
has recently been going the round of the newspapers,
that a sub-postmaster of an Oxfordshire
village fixed this notice up: "Have gone fishing.
Will be back in time to sell stamps," the sub-postmistress
of this Somersetshire hamlet went
away for days without putting up any notice
whatever, and left her son to supply the inhabitants
with postage stamps when he got home in the
evening from his work as an agricultural labourer.
Still, people did not complain, so that they may be
regarded as accessories to the sub-postmistress's
delinquencies. There was, however, a postal super-session
in that village!</p>

<p>There is still in the rural service a postman
who labours under the disabilities of having only
one arm and of being unable to read or write.
He has not a very extensive delivery, and so his
pockets are made to do duty in the place of
the faculty of reading. The left breast pocket
indicates that letters placed in it are for Cliff
Farm, those in the right breast pocket for Rush<!--[331.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Hill Farm, several other pockets serving in like
manner.</p>

<p>From very old official books sent into store on the
change of holders of sub-offices, it is noticeable that
the writing of fifty years ago was much superior to
that of the present day, indicating that sub-postmasters
of olden time either took more interest
in caligraphy than their successors, or possibly had
more leisure in which to make the necessary entries
than is afforded in the present period of high
pressure.</p>

<p>'Tis strange that it was so, as at the time the steel
pen had not ousted the quill. Even so short a time
as forty years since a new intrant to the Post
Office, hailing from the Emerald Isle, had, like all
other new-comers, to enter his name and address in
the Order Book on his first introduction to St.
Martin's-le-Grand. A steel pen was handed to him,
with which he dallied for a time, and when asked
why he did not proceed, said: "Sure, I was waiting
for a feather."</p>

<p>The institution for the care of consumption
started in this country, and known as Nordrach-upon-Mendip,
is in the Bristol postal district at<!--[332.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
one of its most distant points on the range of the
Mendip Hills, at an altitude of 850 feet above sea
level. It has already played an important part as
regards the Bristol Post Office, inasmuch as a consumptive
telegraph clerk has benefited considerably
from the new treatment, and has indeed left the
institution as cured. It is not generally known that
until recently there existed a small Convalescent
Home on the Mendips, but "Cosy Corner," founded
and maintained by Sir Edward Hill, K.C.B., stood
there as such, and it served a good part as regards a
postal servant. A postman employed at the Bristol
railway station as mail porter, who had suffered
from a serious attack of typhoid fever, and who had
been verily at death's door, passed several weeks at
this rural retreat, and derived such benefit from the
kind treatment he received and from the bracing air
of the district that he quite recovered from his ailment
and is now in robust health. "Cosy Corner"
has now been affiliated to Nordrach-upon-Mendip.</p>

<p>The rule of the Service is that coins, postage
stamps, and other articles of value picked up in a
sorting office are regarded as treasure trove and
have to be handed over to the authorities for<!--[333.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
disposal; but a letter carrier's round can hardly be
regarded in the light of a Post Office, and so a
postman of the Thornbury district who at Aust
Cliff, picked up a well-preserved bronze coin with
the image and superscription of Claudius C&aelig;sar
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 41-54) did not consider himself called upon
to give it up to the sub-postmaster, but disposed of
it for the sum of 15s. 6d. The purchaser presented
it to the Leicester Museum.</p>

<p>Tradition hath it that Miss Hannah More, the
celebrated authoress and philanthropist, when residing
(1770) at Wrington, near Bristol, in the churchyard
of which place her remains now repose, made an
arrangement with the postman of the period whereby
on passing along the road near her residence he was
to signal to her when any event of importance had
occurred. Her sitting and bedroom windows commanded
a view of the walk near which the postman
had to pass, so that she could see him coming, and
she always hurried down to the wicket-gate in
readiness to meet him when he put up his flag. A
son of the postman, now alive, remembers well that
his father told him that he had given the signal on
the death of Queen, Caroline. It was outside the<!--[334.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
postman's function, to wave the red flag with which
Mistress Hannah, had provided him, but Post Office
matters were not carried on so strictly in those days
as under the present regime. The Wrington postman
obtained the news about important passing
events from the mail-man who rode through the
village on his way from Bristol to Axbridge.
George Vowles, who died twenty-six years ago, at
the ripe age of 88 years, was the mail-man who
conveyed to the villages on his way the news of the
battle of Waterloo, brought down from London by
the mail coach, which had been decorated with
laurels and flowers in honour of the great event.<!--[335.png]-->

<h5>GENERAL FREE DELIVERY OF LETTERS.</h5>


<p>No stone has been left unturned in the endeavour
to afford a free delivery of letters at the door of
every house in the district; and at last all houses
and cottages, even in the remotest localities, have
been reached, and the woodman, the gamekeeper,
and the lone cottager now receive a daily visit from
the postman. In visiting out of the way places of
the kind with a view to arranging a delivery,
the surveyor has to look out for dogs. A certain
warren house in this district affords a typical
case. It is far from the ordinary haunts of man,
and was without an official delivery on account of
its extreme inaccessibility. The approach is through
a deep gorge, known as Goblin Combe, and the
path to the house is precipitous. The gamekeeper
residing there had to send to a farmhouse a mile
and a quarter distant for his letters, which the
obliging farmer had consented to take in for him.
The attempts of the staff to arrange a method of<!--[336.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
delivery by postmen had long been baffled. At the
time when the writer went to view the place there
was a rumour in the neighbourhood that, owing to
serious depredations by poachers, fierce dogs roamed
the enclosed warren; and on passing out on to the
warren from the wood corner, there was observed
standing on a wall near the house what in the
distance and misty morn, appeared to be a large
bloodhound, and so the advance had to be made
warily. The attendant rural postman was armed
with a riding whip, on which his grip tightened,
for he had already been four times bitten by dogs,
as the scars on his hand testified, and he desired to
guard himself against another attack. At last, as the
place was neared, the object of distrust was found to
be&mdash;a large goat! Another out-of-the-way place in
the same neighbourhood, also unserved by the postman,
was a woodman's house in a dense wood, which,
with its bowling-green, is said once to have been
used by "Bristol bloods" of old time as a safe
retreat where they could indulge in a little business
connected with the prize ring and cock fighting.
That the Duke of Norfolk's liberal policy in Her
Majesty's Diamond Jubilee year has proved a boon<!--[337.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
and a blessing to many residents in isolated spots
is indicated, for instance, by what a poor woman
living in a wild district stated. She had recently
to trudge the whole way from her house to Bristol,
a distance of eight miles out and eight miles back,
while a letter which would have obviated her
journey had been lying undelivered for days at a
Post Office only two miles off.</p>

<p>Blaize Castle, which is within four miles of the
Head Post Office, was singularly enough almost the
last habitation in the Bristol district which was
granted a free delivery of letters daily, for until 1898
the postman in his official capacity had never
penetrated to that rock-elevated and remote part
of the Blaize Woods where the castle stands.
That reproach to the Bristol district has now been
removed, and the custodians of the castle have
obtained their rights as citizens of the great kingdom
in having their letters delivered at the door daily
by the Postmaster-General's representative. It
was a difficult matter to find out all the houses at
which the postman did not call, and this particular
castle, which is now only occupied by caretakers,
was not notified by the rural postman, as the<!--[338.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
occupiers had signified to him that they did not
care for a delivery and were quite satisfied if the
letters were left in the village till called for. The
circumstance may be of interest to Bristolians,
from the fact that Blaize Castle is spoken of by
many but is seen by very few. Its flagstaff is
visible from some little distance, but the castle
itself can scarcely be discerned through its wooded
surroundings, even from the far-famed Arbutus
Walk, which is separated from it by a deep gorge.
The castle is situated on a lofty plateau in the
midst of the large woods. Close to it is a
sheer perpendicular rock, three hundred feet
high, known as "The Giant's leap." The castle
is said to have derived its name from St. Blaisius,
the Spanish patron of wool-combers, to whom a
chapel was dedicated on a hill in the grounds
where the castle now stands, and where there was
once a Roman encampment. The interest attaching
to this castle is enhanced from a postal point of
view by the circumstance that the son of the lady
who owns the property married a daughter of the
late Postmaster-General, the Right Hon. H. C.
Raikes.<!--[339.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>


<p>Mr. Raikes was one of the hardest working of
Postmasters-General. So diligent indeed was he,
that almost nightly, when the House of Commons
was sitting, the right hon. gentleman, after all
other Members had gone home, retired to his
official room and went through the papers which
had been sent up from the Post Office for his
consideration. So absorbed would he become in the
documents, which he read carefully through from
end to end, so that he might judge from his own
standpoint and not from that of his official advisers,
that he would sit well into the small hours of the
morning, whilst that patient and most obliging of
officials, the postmaster of the House, Mr. Pike,
kept weary vigil, waiting to take the despatch-bag
to the Post Office in the City before he went home
to his well-earned rest. Mr. Raikes's invariably
clear and even writing betokened that, long past
the hour for bed as the time might be, he never
had any idea of doing his work in a hurry. He
was probably known to many of the citizens of
Bristol, through his frequent visits to a mansion
on the Westbury side of the Downs.<!--[340.png]-->

<h5>LOCAL RETURNED LETTER OFFICE.</h5>


<p>The Bristol Post Office has its returned letter
branch, with which almost all the towns in the
West of England, and South Wales are affiliated
for "dead letter" work. Through its agency over
a million letters and postal packets are returned to
senders annually. Book packets and circulars form
50 per cent. of the total number, and of these only
75 per cent. can be restored to the persons who
posted them. Over 10,000 letters containing
property are recorded in the ledgers, and they
represent a total value in cash, bank-notes, bills,
cheques, postage stamps, etc., of about &pound;36,000
per annum, nearly the whole of which reaches the
hands of the senders. About 400 letters containing
money orders, and 1,700 letters containing value,
compulsorily registered, are returned in the course of
the year. Amongst the curiosities of returned letter<!--[341.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
office experience may be mentioned the following.
A letter was received thus peculiarly addressed:&mdash;"Miss
----, 4, Pleasant View, in that beautiful city
which charms even eyes familiar with the masterpieces
of Bramanto and Palladio, and which the
genius of Anstey and of Smollett, of Frances
Burney and of Jane Austen has made classic
ground." The pundits in the returned letter office
who deal with derelict letters properly divined that
the place so glowingly described was Bath, and
issuing the letter accordingly, it was duly delivered
in the fair city.</p>

<p>A packet was received simply addressed "Post
Office, Bristol, to be called for." The contents were
an army reserve man's discharge papers and pension
application forms. The application bore evidence
that it referred to Lichfield, and the packet was
accordingly sent to that military dep&ocirc;t. Two or
three days afterwards an old soldier called at the
Bristol office for his letter, and could not possibly
understand why it had been opened in the returned
letter branch, and the contents sent to Lichfield.
His fury was unbounded, and he consigned all and
sundry to Hades. His papers were soon obtained<!--[342.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
for him from Lichfield, and his gratitude at getting
them, was as effusively manifested as his disappointment
had been in not finding the papers awaiting
him on first application. His thanks were conveyed
in the following terse communication:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Boss,&mdash;A thousand pardons, everything
comes right to those who wait. Patience is a virtue.</p>

<p>
"Obt servt,<br />
W. H. &mdash;&mdash;."<br />
</p>

<p>"Sir," wrote a Bristol citizen on a postcard, "I
have lost a ingine off 3 gine oneing to the delay
of a post care wich Mr. &mdash;&mdash; send of wine ts plaa
to ingury and abould youre turly I &mdash;&mdash;, 10, &mdash;&mdash; lane
rielence Bristol." It was not at first apparent what
the writer of the card actually required, but by
degrees it was made out that what he meant was:&mdash;"I
have lost an engagement of 3 guineas owing
to the delay of a postcard which Mr. &mdash;&mdash; sent, of
Wine Street. Please to enquire and oblige, yours
truly, I. &mdash;&mdash;, 10, &mdash;&mdash; Lane, Residence, Bristol."</p>

<p>Danger lurks in unexpected places, even for Post
Office cleaners. Packages which have remained in
the returned letter office for the prescribed period<!--[343.png]-->
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
have to be destroyed from time to time. Sometimes
they contain chemicals. It chanced that at Bristol
one of the charwomen, when pouring out hot water
into a large waste bucket, was startled by the
emission from the bucket of a fierce, bright, flame
which badly burned her hand and caused her
no small fright. The flame lasted for a minute.
The fumes were overpowering, and unpleasantly
pervaded the whole telegraph gallery above.
Upon investigation, it appeared that another charwoman
who had been instructed to "dispose" of a
bottle of sodium amalgam, had carelessly emptied
it into the waste bucket with the startling result
narrated.<br /></p>


<p>The Post Office is ever progressing, and in course
of time there will be further particulars for a future
writer to relate concerning the "Bristol Royal Mail."</p>
